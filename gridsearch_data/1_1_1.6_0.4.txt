The life of a small-town girl only ever seemed to be one of boredom and simplicity. She would wake up each day, do the same things she always did, and go to bed with nothing new having happened. But on this particular day, something was different.
 She woke up feeling excited, as if something great was going to happen. And sure enough, by the end of the day she had won the lottery. She was a millionaire overnight.

The girl could hardly believe her luck. She immediately quit her job and started planning all of the things she would do with her new found wealth. She would travel the world, buy a huge house, and finally be able to live the life she always dreamed of.

For a while, everything seemed to be going perfectly. But then slowly but surely, things started to unravel. The girl realized that having all this money didn't make her happy like she thought it would. In fact, it only made her more anxious and stressed out than ever before. She missed the simplicity of her old life and longed for those boring days where nothing ever happened.
