The life of a small-town girl only ever seemed to be one of boredom and simplicity. She would wake up each day, do the same things she always did, and go to bed with nothing new having happened. But on this particular day, something was different.
 She woke up to the sound of birds chirping merrily outside her window, and the sun shone in with such intensity that it felt like it was blessing her with its presence. She got out of bed and stretched her arms up towards the sky, taking a deep breath in and feeling alive for the first time in she didn't know how long.

She went about her day as usual, but with a newfound skip in her step and a smile on her face. Everything felt new and exciting, and she even found herself laughing out loud at the little things that used to bore her. She felt like she was living for the first time, and she was loving every second of it.

As she was lying in bed that night, she looked up at the stars and whispered, "Thank you." She didn't know what for, but she knew that something had changed within her and she was grateful. She closed her eyes with a smile on her face, feeling content and at peace.
