The life of a small-town girl only ever seemed to be one of boredom and simplicity. She would wake up each day, do the same things she always did, and go to bed with nothing new having happened. But on this particular day, something was different.
 She woke up feeling as though something exciting was going to happen. And sure enough, by the time she went to bed that night, her life had changed forever.

The girl had always been a bit of an outsider. She was never quite sure why, but she always felt like she didn't quite fit in with the other kids at school. So when she was approached by the new girl in town and asked to be friends, she was thrilled. Finally, someone who wanted to be friends with her!

The two girls quickly became inseparable. They would spend all their free time together, talking and laughing about everything and anything. The small-town girl had never been so happy. It felt like finally her life had some purpose.

But then one day, out of the blue, the new girl stopped talking to her. The small-town girl couldn't understand what she'd done wrong and why her friend would just suddenly stop speaking to her. She was heartbroken and lost without her best friend.

But then, a few weeks later, the new girl came back into her life as if nothing had ever happened. And from that day on, the small-town girl knew that things were going to be different from now on; because she finally had someone who truly understood her."
