The life of a small-town girl only ever seemed to be one of boredom and simplicity. She would wake up each day, do the same things she always did, and go to bed with nothing new having happened. But on this particular day, something was different.
 She woke up feeling excited, as if something great was about to happen. And sure enough, by the time she went to bed that night, her life had changed forever.

The girl had always been a bit of an outsider. She was never quite sure why, but she always felt like she didn't quite fit in with the other kids at school. So when she was approached by the new girl in town and asked to be friends, she was thrilled. Finally, someone who wanted to be friends with her!

The two girls quickly became inseparable. They would spend all their free time together, talking and laughing until they were both exhausted. The small-town girl had never been so happy. It felt like finally she belonged somewhere.

But then one day, out of the blue, the new girl stopped talking to her. She would completely ignore her when they were at school together, and when the small-town girl tried to talk to her, she would just walk away.

The small-town girl was heartbroken. She didn't understand what she could have done wrong. She thought back over all their conversations and memories, trying to figure out where things had gone wrong, but she came up empty. Eventually, she just had to accept that the new girl didn't want to be friends anymore, and she was alone again.

But even though she was alone, the small-town girl still felt different from everyone else. Because now she knew that there was more to life than just boredom and simplicity. There was excitement and adventure too - you just had to go out and find it for yourself.
