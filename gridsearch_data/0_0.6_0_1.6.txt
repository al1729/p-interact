The life of a small-town girl only ever seemed to be one of boredom and simplicity. She would wake up each day, do the same things she always did, and go to bed with nothing new having happened. But on this particular day, something was different.
 She woke up feeling excited, as if something great was about to happen. And sure enough, by the time she went to bed that night, her life had changed forever.

The girl had always been a bit of an outsider. She was never quite sure why, but she always felt like she didn't quite fit in with the other kids at school. So when she was approached by the new girl in town, she was more than happy to make a new friend.

The two girls hit it off immediately, and before long they were inseparable. They would spend hours talking and laughing together, and the small-town girl finally felt like she belonged.

Then one day, out of the blue, the new girl told her that she was moving away. The news came as a shock to the small-town girl, and she was heartbroken. But she knew that she had to be strong, and so she said goodbye to her friend, vowing to keep in touch.

Years passed, and the two girls lost touch. But the small-town girl never forgot her friend, and she always wondered what had become of her.

One day, out of curiosity, she decided to look her up. And to her surprise, she found that her friend was now a famous author. Reading her books, the small-town girl felt like she was finally able to connect with her friend again, and she was filled with pride and happiness.

The small-town girl's life may have been simple, but it was also full of love and friendship. And she knew that she was lucky for that.
