The life of a small-town girl only ever seemed to be one of boredom and simplicity. She would wake up each day, do the same things she always did, and go to bed with nothing new having happened. But on this particular day, something was different.
 She woke up feeling strangely uneasy, as if something terrible was about to happen.

She tried to shake the feeling and go about her day as normal, but the uneasiness only grew. It was like there was a dark cloud hanging over her, following her wherever she went. She tried to ignore it, but by the end of the day the uneasiness had turned into a full-blown sense of dread.

She had a bad feeling about tonight. She couldn't explain it, but she knew that something was going to happen. She tried to tell herself that she was just being silly, but she couldn't shake the feeling.

She went to bed that night feeling scared and alone. She had never felt this way before, and it was a feeling that she never wanted to experience again.

In the middle of the night, she was awoken by a noise. It sounded like something was moving around downstairs. She slowly got out of bed, heart racing, and crept downstairs to see what was going on.

As she reached the bottom of the staircase, she saw a figure standing in the shadows. She couldn't see who it was, but she knew that they were there. Watching her.

The figure slowly began to move towards her, and she instinctively stepped back. She didn't know what to do, and she was terrified.

Suddenly, the figure lunged at her, and she screamed. She was sure that this was it. She was going to die.

But then, just as suddenly as the attack had happened, it stopped. The figure was gone, and she was alone again.

She didn't know what to make of what had just happened, but one thing was for sure.

She was never going to forget that night.
