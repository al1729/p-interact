The life of a small-town girl only ever seemed to be one of boredom and simplicity. She would wake up each day, do the same things she always did, and go to bed with nothing new having happened. But on this particular day, something was different.
 She woke up feeling excited, as if something great was about to happen. And sure enough, by the time she went to bed that night, her life had changed forever.

The girl had always been a bit of an outsider in her small town. She was too shy and introverted to really fit in with the other kids her age. So when she heard about the new boy who was moving into town, she was intrigued. Maybe this could be someone she could connect with?

As it turned out, the boy was everything she'd hoped for and more. They quickly became friends, spending all their free time together. And before long, they were inseparable. It felt like finallyshe belonged somewhere; finallyshe had found her place in the world.

But just as suddenly as he'd entered her life, he disappeared from it again just as quickly - leaving only a note behind saying goodbye without any explanation why.. heartbroken ,the girl tried to carry on but eventually left that small-town herself never looking back .
