The life of a small-town girl only ever seemed to be one of boredom and simplicity. She would wake up each day, do the same things she always did, and go to bed with nothing new having happened. But on this particular day, something was different.
 She woke up feeling excited, as if something great was about to happen. And sure enough, by the time she went to bed that night, her life had changed forever.

The girl had always been a bit of an outsider. She was never quite sure why, but she always felt like she didn't quite fit in with the other kids at school. So when she was approached by the new girl in town and asked to be friends, she was thrilled. Finally, someone who wanted to be friends with her!

They quickly became inseparable, and the small-town girl found herself living a life full of adventure for the first time. Everything was new and exciting with her friend by her side. They would explore the town together, getting into all sorts of mischief along the way. The small-town girl had never been so happy.

But then one day, her friend disappeared without a trace. The small-town girl searched for her high and low, but she could never find her again. She was heartbroken and lost without her friend, but eventually she learned to move on.

Years later, she bumped into her old friend again completely by chance. They catching up over coffee, and it was like no time had passed at all. The small-town girl finally felt whole again, and she knew that this friendship was meant to be.
