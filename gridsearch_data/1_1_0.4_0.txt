The life of a small-town girl only ever seemed to be one of boredom and simplicity. She would wake up each day, do the same things she always did, and go to bed with nothing new having happened. But on this particular day, something was different.
 She woke up feeling excited for the first time in a long time. She couldn't explain why, but she had a feeling that something special was going to happen.

As she went about her day, she noticed that everyone she came across seemed to be in a good mood. Even the grumpy old man at the grocery store was humming to himself as he bagged her groceries. She started to feel like maybe her good feeling was contagious.

By the time she got home, she was practically bursting with anticipation. She ran to her room and threw open the door, expecting to see something amazing. But there was nothing there. No fairy godmother, no magical creatures, no nothing. Just her boring old room.

She realized then that the only thing that was different was her own attitude. And she decided that from then on, she would try to see the good in every day. Because who knows? Maybe one day she really would wake up to something magical.
