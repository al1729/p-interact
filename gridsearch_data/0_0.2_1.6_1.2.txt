The life of a small-town girl only ever seemed to be one of boredom and simplicity. She would wake up each day, do the same things she always did, and go to bed with nothing new having happened. But on this particular day, something was different.
 She woke up feeling excited, as if something great was about to happen. And sure enough, by the time she went to bed that night, her life had changed forever.

The girl had always been a bit of an outsider. She was never quite sure why, but she always felt like she didn't quite fit in with the other kids at school. So when she was approached by a group of girls who seemed to be planning something exciting, she was more than happy to go along with whatever they had planned.

As it turned out, the girls were planning a prank on one of their classmates - and the target just happened to be the most popular girl in school. The small-town girl couldn't believe her luck; finally she would get to be part of something interesting!

That night, they carried out their plan and it was even more successful than they could have hoped for. The whole school was talking about it the next day and, for once, the small-town girl felt like she belonged somewhere. It might not have been conventional popularity, but it suited her just fine.
