The life of a small-town girl only ever seemed to be one of boredom and simplicity. She would wake up each day, do the same things she always did, and go to bed with nothing new having happened. But on this particular day, something was different.
 She woke up feeling excited, as if something great was about to happen. And sure enough, by the time she went to bed that night, her life had changed forever.

The girl had always been a bit of an outsider. She was never quite sure why, but she always felt like she didn't quite fit in with the other kids at school. So when she was approached by the new girl in town and asked to be friends, she was thrilled. Finally, someone who wanted to be friends with her!

The two girls quickly became inseparable. They would spend all their free time together, talking and laughing about everything and nothing. The small-town girl had never been so happy.

But then one day, out of the blue, the new girl stopped talking to her. She would walk right past her in the hallways at school without even acknowledging her existence. The small-town girl was heartbroken and couldn't understand what she had done wrong.

She tried reaching out to the new girl multiple times, but it was clear that she didn't want anything to do with her anymore. Finally, after months of pain and loneliness, the small-town girl gave up and accepted that she would never know what happened or why things changed between them so suddenly.

But even though she's no longer friends with the new girl, that brief period of happiness has stayed with her forever and changed her life for the better
