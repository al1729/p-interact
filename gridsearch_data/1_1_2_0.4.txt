The life of a small-town girl only ever seemed to be one of boredom and simplicity. She would wake up each day, do the same things she always did, and go to bed with nothing new having happened. But on this particular day, something was different.
 She woke up to the sun beaming in through her window, casting a beautiful golden glow throughout her room. She felt more alive than she ever had before and decided to make the most of it.

She walked down the streets of her town, taking in all the sights and sounds that she had so easily become numb to. Everything seemed new and exciting now that she was seeing it with fresh eyes. She even got lost on purpose a few times, just so she could explore some of the places she had never been before.

By the end of the day, she was exhausted but delighted with how her day had gone. As she lay in bed that night, looking up at the stars shining bright overhead,she knew that this was only the beginning of something special."
