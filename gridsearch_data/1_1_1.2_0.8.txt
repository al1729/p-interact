The life of a small-town girl only ever seemed to be one of boredom and simplicity. She would wake up each day, do the same things she always did, and go to bed with nothing new having happened. But on this particular day, something was different.
 When she woke up, the sun was shining brighter than it ever had before, the birds were singing louder, and the colors seemed more vibrant.

The girl decided to take advantage of this rare occurrence and went outside to explore her neighborhood. She walked down the street, taking in all the new sights and sounds around her. The flowers in front of houses were blooming more beautifully than ever before, and even the grass seemed greener. She had never seen anything like it.

As she continued on her walk, she came across a butterfly that was fluttering about erratically. It was as if it was trying to tell her something. Following its lead, she walked towards the edge of town where she had never been before. She climbed over a fence into a meadow full of wildflowers. The butterfly led her deeper into the meadow until they came upon a stream. Sitting on a rock by the stream was an old woman who looked like she had been there for years."


"Who are you?" The girl asked hesitantly.

"I am nature," replied the old woman."And I have come to give you a gift."
She reached into her pocket and pulled out a small Stone with symbols inscribed on it." place this stone under your pillow tonight, and when you wake up tomorrow morning, your life will be changed forever." With that, the old woman disappeared back into thin air leaving the bewildered girl alone with only the stone in her hand
