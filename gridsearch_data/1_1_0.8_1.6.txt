The life of a small-town girl only ever seemed to be one of boredom and simplicity. She would wake up each day, do the same things she always did, and go to bed with nothing new having happened. But on this particular day, something was different.
 She woke up feeling oddly excited, as if something great was about to happen. And sure enough, when she walked outside, she saw a sign that said "circus coming to town!"

She had never seen a circus before, and the thought of all the fun and excitement it would bring filled her with anticipation. She couldn't wait to see the amazing acts and marvel at the skilled performers. The circus arrived that afternoon, and it did not disappoint. She laugh along with the clowns, gasped at the daring feats of the acrobats, and was thoroughly entertained by the whole show. It was everything she had hoped for and more.

When it was over, she went home with a smile on her face, feeling like this was one day she would always remember. That night, she fell asleep dreaming of running away to join the circus herself.
