The life of a small-town girl only ever seemed to be one of boredom and simplicity. She would wake up each day, do the same things she always did, and go to bed with nothing new having happened. But on this particular day, something was different.
 She woke up feeling oddly excited, as if something good was going to happen. And sure enough, by the time she went to bed that night, her life had changed forever.

The girl had always been a bit of an outsider. She was shy and not particularly popular in school. But on this day, she found herself surrounded by new friends. They were all kids who had just moved to town, and they welcomed her with open arms. They invited her to hang out with them, and she found herself having the time of her life.

She laughed harder than she ever had before, and felt more alive than she ever had. It was as if she had finally found her place in the world. When she went home that night, she went to bed with a smile on her face, knowing that everything was going to change from now on.
