The life of a small-town girl only ever seemed to be one of boredom and simplicity. She would wake up each day, do the same things she always did, and go to bed with nothing new having happened. But on this particular day, something was different.
 She woke up feeling excited, as if something great was about to happen. And sure enough, by the time she went to bed that night, her life had changed forever.

The girl had always been a bit of an outsider. She was never quite sure why, but she always felt like she didn't quite fit in with the other kids at school. So when she was approached by the new girl in town and asked to be friends, she was thrilled. Finally, someone who wanted to be friends with her!

The two girls quickly became inseparable. They would spend all their free time together, talking and laughing about everything and anything. The small-town girl had never been so happy.

But then one day, out of the blue, the new girl stopped talking to her. She would completely ignore her when they were at school together, and wouldn't even acknowledge her existence outside of school hours. The small-town girl was heartbroken.

She tried everything she could think of to try and win back her friend's affections, but nothing worked. Eventually, she came to accept that their friendship was over. But even though the pain of losing her friend was still fresh, she knew that life went on. And slowly but surely, she started to rebuild her life without her former best friend by her side.
