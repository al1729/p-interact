The life of a small-town girl only ever seemed to be one of boredom and simplicity. She would wake up each day, do the same things she always did, and go to bed with nothing new having happened. But on this particular day, something was different.
 The girl woke up feeling different. She couldn't quite put her finger on it, but she knew something was different.

As she went about her day, she began to notice more and more things that were different. The way the sun shone down on her skin, the way the breeze felt as it brushed against her face, the way the birds were singing. It was all so new and so beautiful.

She continued to feel this way all day long and into the night. She went to bed with a smile on her face, knowing that something special had happened. She had finally found herself.
