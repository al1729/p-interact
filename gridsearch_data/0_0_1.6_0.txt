The life of a small-town girl only ever seemed to be one of boredom and simplicity. She would wake up each day, do the same things she always did, and go to bed with nothing new having happened. But on this particular day, something was different.
 She woke up feeling excited, as if something great was about to happen. And sure enough, by the time she went to bed that night, her life had changed forever.

The girl had always been a bit of an outsider. She was never quite sure why, but she always felt like she didn't quite fit in with the other kids at school. So when she was approached by a group of girls who seemed to be planning something exciting, she was more than happy to go along with whatever they had planned.

As it turned out, the girls were planning a prank on the school bully. They were going to put itching powder in his backpack so that he would have a terrible day at school. The girl was hesitant at first, but then she thought about how much fun it would be to see the bully suffer. So she agreed to help out.

The next day, everything went according to plan and the bully ended up covered in itchiness from head to toe. The girl and her friends laughed and high-fived each other as they watched him scratch himself raw. It was one of the best days of her life - finally feeling like part of a group and getting revenge on someone who had made her life miserable for so long
