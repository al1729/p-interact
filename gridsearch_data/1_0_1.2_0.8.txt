The life of a small-town girl only ever seemed to be one of boredom and simplicity. She would wake up each day, do the same things she always did, and go to bed with nothing new having happened. But on this particular day, something was different.
 She woke up feeling excited, as if something great was about to happen. And sure enough, by the time she went to bed that night, her life had changed forever.

The girl had always been a bit of an outsider. She was never quite sure why, but she always felt like she didn't quite fit in with the other kids at school. So when she was approached by the new girl in town and asked to be friends, she was thrilled. Finally, someone who wanted to be friends with her!

The two girls quickly became inseparable. They would spend all their free time together, talking and laughing until they were both exhausted. The small-town girl had never been so happy. It felt like finally her life had some purpose.

But then one day, out of nowhere, the new girl stopped talking to her. The small-town girl couldn't understand what she had done wrong and why her friend would just abandon her like that. She was heartbroken and lost without her best friend.

But eventually, she started to move on. She made new friends and slowly but surely forgot about the pain of being rejected by the one person she thought cared about her most. And looking back on it now, she realized that even though it hurt at the time, getting dumped by her best friend was one of the best things that ever happened to her because it made her realize that she is strong enough to stand on her own two feet without anyone's help - including a best friend's."
