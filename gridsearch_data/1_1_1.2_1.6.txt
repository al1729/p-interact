The life of a small-town girl only ever seemed to be one of boredom and simplicity. She would wake up each day, do the same things she always did, and go to bed with nothing new having happened. But on this particular day, something was different.
 The girl woke up to find that she had won the lottery.

With her newfound wealth, the sky was the limit for what she could do. She could travel the world, buy a new house, or start her own business. She was finally free from the constraints of her small town life and could live out her dreams.

The girl went on to lead a very happy and successful life, thanks in part to that one fateful day when she won the lottery.
