The life of a small-town girl only ever seemed to be one of boredom and simplicity. She would wake up each day, do the same things she always did, and go to bed with nothing new having happened. But on this particular day, something was different.
 She woke up feeling excited, as if something great was about to happen. And sure enough, by the time she went to bed that night, her life had changed forever.

The girl had always been a bit of an outsider. She was never quite sure why, but she always felt like she didn't quite fit in with the other kids at school. So when she was approached by the new girl in town and asked to be friends, she was thrilled. Finally, someone who wanted to be friends with her!

They quickly became inseparable, and the small-town girl found herself living a life full of adventure for the first time ever. From staying up all night talking to exploring every inch of their hometown together, she finally felt like she belonged somewhere.

And then one day, out of nowhere, the new girl moved away without even saying goodbye. The small-town girl was heartbroken but decided that maybe it was just meant to be a brief chapter in her life and that there would be other adventures ahead waiting for her.
