The life of a small-town girl only ever seemed to be one of boredom and simplicity. She would wake up each day, do the same things she always did, and go to bed with nothing new having happened. But on this particular day, something was different.
 She woke up feeling excited, as if something great was about to happen. And sure enough, by the time she went to bed that night, her life had changed forever.

The girl had always been a bit of an outsider in her small town. She was too shy and introverted to really fit in with the other kids her age. So when she heard about the new boy who was moving into town, she was intrigued. Maybe this could be her chance to make a friend.

As it turned out, the boy was just as shy as she was. They bonded over their shared love of books and quickly became inseparable. Everyone in town started talking about how cute they were together and how they were destined to be together forever.

And then one day, out of nowhere, the boy left town without even saying goodbye to her. The girl was heartbroken but refused to give up on him; she knew he would come back eventually (after all, destiny couldn't be wrong). And sure enough, a few months later he returned - but not alone this time...he came back with a beautiful wife on his arm."
