The life of a small-town girl only ever seemed to be one of boredom and simplicity. She would wake up each day, do the same things she always did, and go to bed with nothing new having happened. But on this particular day, something was different.
 She woke up feeling unusually alive and excited for what the day might bring.

As she went about her morning routine, she felt a sense of anticipation building inside of her. She couldn't help but smile as she went through the motions, wondering what was going to happen. By the time she was finished getting ready for the day, she was practically bouncing with excitement.

She walked out into the small town square and immediately realized that something strange was going on. Everyone seemed to be moving about with a sense of purpose, rushing to who knows where. It wasn't long before she saw somebody running towards her - it was her best friend!

"What's going on?" The small-town girl asked breathlessly as soon as her friend reached her side. "Why is everyone in such a hurry?" 
"Haven't you heard?!" Her best friend replied urgently."There's a traveling circus in town!"
