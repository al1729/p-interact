Write an award-winning 3rd person short-story. The life of a small-town girl only ever seemed to be one of boredom and simplicity. She would wake up each day, do the same things she always did, and go to bed with nothing new having happened. But on this particular day, something was different.
 She woke up feeling elated, as if something wonderful was about to happen. And sure enough, by the time she went to bed that night, her life had changed forever.

She'd been expecting it for months ever since she found out he was moving to their town but still hadn't dared hope it would actually happen - and yet there he was, standing on her doorstep with a smile that could light up the universe. She invited him in without hesitation and they spent the day catching up on old times; it felt like no time had passed at all since they were last together.


By the end of the day she knew one thing for sure: this reunion wasn't just a happy coincidence - it was destiny. They belonged together and nothing was going to keep them apart again...
