The life of a small-town girl only ever seemed to be one of boredom and simplicity. She would wake up each day, do the same things she always did, and go to bed with nothing new having happened. But on this particular day, something was different.
 It started like any other day, but as the hours went on, she began to feel a sense of excitement in the air. She couldn't explain it, but she knew something good was going to happen.

Sure enough, by the end of the day, her world had been turned upside down. She had been approached by a talent scout who saw potential in her and wanted to make her a star. From that day forward, her life would never be the same. She would go on to achieve great things, but always remember the small town girl who made it big.
