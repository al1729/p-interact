The life of a small-town girl only ever seemed to be one of boredom and simplicity. She would wake up each day, do the same things she always did, and go to bed with nothing new having happened. But on this particular day, something was different.
 She woke up feeling excited, as if something great was about to happen. And sure enough, by the time she went to bed that night, her life had changed forever.

The girl had always been a bit of an outsider. She was never quite sure why, but she always felt like she didn't quite fit in with the other kids at school. So when she was approached by the new girl in town and asked to be friends, she was thrilled. Finally, someone who wanted to be friends with her!

The new girl was different from anyone she'd ever met before. She was exciting and fun and always up for anything. The two of them quickly became inseparable, and the small-town girl's life was transformed. No longer were her days filled with boredom and simplicity; now they were filled with adventure and laughter.

She would never forget the day that her life changed forever. It was the day that she realized that even though she may have been an outsider before, she didn't have to be anymore. Because now she had a friend who loved her just as much as she loved them.
