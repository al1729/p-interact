The life of a small-town girl only ever seemed to be one of boredom and simplicity. She would wake up each day, do the same things she always did, and go to bed with nothing new having happened. But on this particular day, something was different.
 She woke up feeling excited, as if something great was about to happen. And sure enough, by the time she went to bed that night, her life had changed forever.

The girl had always been a bit of an outsider. She was never quite sure why, but she always felt like she didn't quite fit in with the other kids at school. So when she was approached by the new girl in town and asked to be friends, she was thrilled. Finally, someone who wanted to be friends with her!

The two girls quickly became inseparable. They would spend all their free time together, talking and laughing until they were both exhausted. The small-town girl had never been so happy. It felt like finally her life had some purpose.

But then one day, out of nowhere, the new girl stopped talking to her. The small-town girl couldn't understand what she'd done wrong and spent hours wondering what could have happened. Had she said something to upset her friend? Or maybe the new girl just wasn't interested in being friends anymore? Either way, it hurt deeply and left the small-town girl feeling more alone than ever before.

But just when she thought things couldn't get any worse, they did. The new girl started spreading rumors about her around school; saying that she was weird and creepy and nobody should be friends with her. Suddenly, everyone seemed to be against her and she didn't know how to make it stop.

She tried speaking to the new girl again but it only made things worse; now everyone thought she was a stalker! Desperate and alone, the small-town girl turned to the only person who seemed to understand: her diary . . .
