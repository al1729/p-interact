The life of a small-town girl only ever seemed to be one of boredom and simplicity. She would wake up each day, do the same things she always did, and go to bed with nothing new having happened. But on this particular day, something was different.
 She woke up feeling excited, as if something great was about to happen. And sure enough, by the time she went to bed that night, her life had changed forever.

The girl had always been a bit of an outsider. She was never quite sure why, but she always felt like she didn't quite fit in with the other kids at school. So when she was approached by the new girl in town and asked to be friends, she was thrilled. Finally, someone who wanted to be friends with her!

The new girl was different from anyone she'd ever met before. She was exciting and fun and always up for anything. The two of them quickly became inseparable, and the small-town girl's life was transformed. No longer was she bored and lonely; now she had a best friend who made every day an adventure.

One day, out of the blue, the new girl announced that she was moving away. The small-town girl was devastated. She didn't know how she would go back to her old life of boredom and loneliness now that her best friend was gone.

But then the new girl gave her a gift: a box filled with memories of their time together. Now, whenever she feels lonely or bored, the small-town girl can take out the box and remember all the good times they had together. And even though her best friend is gone, she knows that their friendship will last forever.
