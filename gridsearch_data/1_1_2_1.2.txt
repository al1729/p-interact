The life of a small-town girl only ever seemed to be one of boredom and simplicity. She would wake up each day, do the same things she always did, and go to bed with nothing new having happened. But on this particular day, something was different.
 She woke up with a newfound sense of excitement, as if something wonderful was about to happen. And sure enough, it did.

She stepped outside and the first thing she saw was a rainbow stretching across the sky. It was such a beautiful sight that she couldn't help but smile. She felt like anything was possible on this day.

And as it turned out, her hunch was right. Because later that day, she won the lottery! She never would have thought that something so exciting could happen to her in her small town, but it did. And she'll never forget how wonderful that day ended up being."
