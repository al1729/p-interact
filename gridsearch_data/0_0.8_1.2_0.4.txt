The life of a small-town girl only ever seemed to be one of boredom and simplicity. She would wake up each day, do the same things she always did, and go to bed with nothing new having happened. But on this particular day, something was different.
 She woke up feeling excited, as if something great was about to happen. And sure enough, by the time she went to bed that night, her life had changed forever.

The girl had always been a bit of an outsider. She was never quite sure why, but she always felt like she didn't quite fit in with the other kids at school. So when she was approached by the new girl in town and asked to be friends, she was thrilled. Finally, someone who wanted to be friends with her!

The two girls quickly became inseparable. They would spend all their free time together, talking and laughing about everything and nothing. The small-town girl had never been so happy.

But then one day, out of the blue, the new girl stopped talking to her. The small-town girl couldn't understand what she had done wrong and why her friend would just suddenly stop speaking to her. She was heartbroken and lost without her best friend.

But then, a few weeks later, the new girl came back into her life - this time as part of a group of girls who were bullying her mercilessly. The small-town girl was confused and hurt by this sudden change in behavior from her former friend but soon realized that maybe it wasn't personal; maybe the new girl was just trying to fit in with the popular crowd and didn't know how else to go about it.

Despite this realization, the small-town girl couldn't help but feel betrayed by someone who had once meant so much to her. It would be a long time before she could fully trust anyone again but slowly, over time, she began rebuilding herself and moving on from that painful experience
