The life of a small-town girl only ever seemed to be one of boredom and simplicity. She would wake up each day, do the same things she always did, and go to bed with nothing new having happened. But on this particular day, something was different.
 She woke up feeling excited, as if something great was about to happen. And sure enough, by the time she went to bed that night, her life had changed forever.

The girl had always been a bit of an outsider. She was never quite sure why, but she always felt like she didn't quite fit in with the other kids at school. So when she was approached by the new girl in town, she was more than happy to make a friend. The two of them hit it off immediately, and before long they were inseparable.

That day, the girls had made plans to meet up after school. But when the time came, the small-town girl couldn't find her new friend anywhere. She looked all over for her, but she was nowhere to be found. Eventually, she gave up and went home, wondering what could have happened.

It wasn't until later that she found out. Her new friend had been killed that day, the victim of a hit-and-run. The small-town girl was devastated. She mourned the loss of her friend, and vowed to never let anything like that happen again.

And so she became a detective. It was her way of honoring her friend's memory, and making sure that justice was served. She dedicated her life to solving crimes, and quickly became one of the best in the business.

The small-town girl had finally found her calling. And she knew that she would never forget her friend, or the impact that she had on her life.
