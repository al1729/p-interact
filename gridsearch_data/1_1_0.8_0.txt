The life of a small-town girl only ever seemed to be one of boredom and simplicity. She would wake up each day, do the same things she always did, and go to bed with nothing new having happened. But on this particular day, something was different.
 As she left her house to go about her day, she noticed a strange symbol painted on the door. It was a symbol she had never seen before, and it seemed to be beckoning her forward.

Curious, she followed the symbol down the street and around the corner, where it led her to an old abandoned warehouse. She had always been told to stay away from this place, but the mystery of the symbol was too much for her to resist. She cautiously entered the warehouse, half expecting something to jump out at her.

But nothing did. Instead, she found herself in a hidden room, surrounded by candles and strange symbols. In the center of the room was a small table with a book on it. The book seemed to be calling out to her, so she cautiously flipped it open.

Inside, she found a story that captivated her like none other. It was a story of adventure and danger, of magic and castles, of friendship and love. She read Late into the night, only stopping when she realized that dawn was fast approaching. This was a story that would change her life forever; one that she would never forget.
