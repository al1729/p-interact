The life of a small-town girl only ever seemed to be one of boredom and simplicity. She would wake up each day, do the same things she always did, and go to bed with nothing new having happened. But on this particular day, something was different.
 She woke up feeling excited, as if something great was about to happen. And sure enough, by the time she went to bed that night, her life had changed forever.

The girl had always been a bit of a dreamer, and she had always loved stories. So when she found a dusty old book in her attic, she was thrilled. She sat down and began to read, and she was soon transported to a faraway land. She read about princesses and dragons and knights, and she wished she could be a part of their world.

But then she turned the page, and she saw something that made her heart stop. There, in the middle of the book, was a picture of her own town. She couldn't believe it. She read on, and she discovered that the book was about her town - and that she was the star of the story.

The girl was thrilled. She had always wanted something more than the boring life she led, and now she had it. She was the star of her own story, and she was determined to make it a good one.
