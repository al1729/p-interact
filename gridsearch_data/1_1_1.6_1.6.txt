The life of a small-town girl only ever seemed to be one of boredom and simplicity. She would wake up each day, do the same things she always did, and go to bed with nothing new having happened. But on this particular day, something was different.
 She felt a sense of excitement in the air.

As she went about her day, she noticed everyone was going about their business with an extra spring in their step. She even saw a few people she knew exchanging conspiratorial glances and whispering to each other. Something was definitely up.

By the time night fell, the girl could barely contain her curiosity. She slipped out of her house and made her way towards the center of town where she knew everyone would be gathered. And sure enough, there was a large crowd assembled there, all talking in hushed tones and looking around nervously.

In the middle of the group was a man wearing a bright red suit and top hat. He looked very out of place in this small town but somehow also completely at ease. The girl pushed her way through the crowd until she was standing right in front of him."What's going on?"She asked breathlessly."Why is everyone so excited?" 

"I'm sorry miss," said the man with a smile, "but you're just not old enough yet." With that, he turned away from her and continued his conversation with someone else as if she didn't exist
