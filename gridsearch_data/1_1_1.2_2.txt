The life of a small-town girl only ever seemed to be one of boredom and simplicity. She would wake up each day, do the same things she always did, and go to bed with nothing new having happened. But on this particular day, something was different.
 It was as if the world around her had changed overnight, and she didn't know how to react.

As she walked through her town, she noticed that everyone was behaving oddly. They were all walking around with a quizzical look on their faces, as if they were trying to figure out what was going on. The girl continued onwards, until she reached the edge of town. And that's when she saw it.

In the distance, there was a massive wall that stretched from one end of the horizon to the other. It was so high that it blocked out the sun, casting a dark shadow over everything. The girl couldn't believe her eyes. She didn't know what this wall was or why it was here, but she knew one thing for sure: her life would never be boring again.
