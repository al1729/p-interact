The life of a small-town girl only ever seemed to be one of boredom and simplicity. She would wake up each day, do the same things she always did, and go to bed with nothing new having happened. But on this particular day, something was different.
 She woke up feeling excited, as if something great was about to happen. And sure enough, by the time she went to bed that night, her life had changed forever.

The girl had always been a bit of an outsider. She was never quite sure why, but she always felt like she didn't quite fit in with the other kids at school. So when she was approached by the new girl in town and asked to be friends, she was thrilled. Finally, someone who wanted to be friends with her!

The two girls quickly became inseparable. They would spend all their free time together, talking and laughing until they were both exhausted. The small-town girl had never been so happy. It felt like finally her life had some purpose.

It took a long time for the small-town girl to recover from the loss of her friend. But eventually, she did start to move on.
