The life of a small-town girl only ever seemed to be one of boredom and simplicity. She would wake up each day, do the same things she always did, and go to bed with nothing new having happened. But on this particular day, something was different.
 She woke up feeling as if something wonderful was about to happen. And sure enough, by the time she went to bed that night, her life had changed forever.

She had always been a bit of a tom-boy, preferring to play in the dirt with her brother's toys than play with dolls like her sister. So when she saw the shiny new bicycle sitting in front of her house that morning, she knew it was meant for her. She rode that bike all day long, loving the wind whipping through her hair and the feeling of freedom it gave her.

By the end of the day, she had made up her mind: she was going to enter the local bike race. It was something she had always dreamed of doing but never dared to try. With new found confidence, she registered for the race and began training.

Months later, on race day, she lined up at the start line with butterflies in her stomach but a smile on her face. She wasn't expecting to win but just taking part in something so exhilarating was enough for her. As it turned out though, she needn't have worried;she crossed that finish line first and was crowned champion! That small-town girl's life would never be boring again!
