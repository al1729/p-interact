The life of a small-town girl only ever seemed to be one of boredom and simplicity. She would wake up each day, do the same things she always did, and go to bed with nothing new having happened. But on this particular day, something was different.
 She woke up to find that the world around her had changed. The sun was now a deep red, the sky a dark purple. Even the trees and houses seemed to be different shades than they were before.

The girl didn't know what was going on, but she knew that something wasn't right. She decided to venture into town to see if anyone else was around and could tell her what was happening. When she got there, she found that the streets were eerily empty. There wasn't a soul in sight. She walked around for a while, until she finally came across somebody.

The person was an old woman, and she looked just as confused as the girl felt. They each asked each other what was going on, but neither of them had any answers. Eventually, they both just decided to go home and wait it out until morning, in hopes that things would return back to normal then.

But morning never came. The darkness remained, and so did the empty streets. The girl tried leaving town again, but no matter where she went, there was nobody there. It was like she was the only person left in the world. She didn't know what to do or where to go anymore. She felt lost and scared and completely alone.
