The life of a small-town girl only ever seemed to be one of boredom and simplicity. She would wake up each day, do the same things she always did, and go to bed with nothing new having happened. But on this particular day, something was different.
 She woke up feeling as though something exciting was going to happen. As the day went on, she started to feel more and more sure that something special was going to occur.

As the sun began to set, she saw a beautiful rainbow in the sky. She had never seen one before and it filled her with wonder. She watched it for a while, admiring its beauty, before heading inside for the night.

She went to bed with a smile on her face, content in the knowledge that even though her life might be boring to others, there were still moments of magic to be found if she just knew where to look for them.
