The life of a small-town girl only ever seemed to be one of boredom and simplicity. She would wake up each day, do the same things she always did, and go to bed with nothing new having happened. But on this particular day, something was different.
 She woke up feeling excited, as if something great was about to happen. And sure enough, by the time she went to bed that night, her life had changed forever.

The girl had always been a bit of an outsider. She was never quite sure why, but she always felt like she didn't quite fit in with the other kids at school. So when she was approached by the new girl in town and asked to be friends, she was thrilled. Finally, someone who wanted to be friends with her!

The two girls quickly became inseparable. They would spend all their free time together, talking and laughing about everything and nothing. The small-town girl had never been so happy.

But then one day, out of the blue, the new girl stopped talking to her. She would walk right past her in the hallways at school without even acknowledging her existence. The small-town girl was heartbroken.

She tried everything she could think of to try to get the new girl to talk to her again, but nothing worked. Eventually, she just gave up and accepted that their friendship was over.

But then, on that fateful day that everything changed, the new girl came up to her and apologized for what happened. She said she'd been going through a lot lately and hadn't been able to be there for her friend like she should have been. The small-town girl forgave her instantly and they hugged each other tightly.

From that day forward, the two girls were closer than ever before. They swore they would never let anything come between them again and they kept their promise. They remained best friends until the day they both left their small town for good.
