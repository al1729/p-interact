The life of a small-town girl only ever seemed to be one of boredom and simplicity. She would wake up each day, do the same things she always did, and go to bed with nothing new having happened. But on this particular day, something was different.
 She could feel it in the air.

As she went about her daily routine, she couldn’t help but notice the strange looks people were giving her. It was as if they knew something she didn’t. She tried to shake off the feeling, but it only grew stronger as the day went on.

By the time night had fallen, she was certain something was going to happen. She couldn’t explain why, but she just knew it. And sure enough, as she crawled into bed, she heard a noise outside her window.

She slowly got out of bed and crept towards the window, heart racing in anticipation. When she looked outside, she saw a figure standing in the shadows. For a moment, they simply stared at each other. And then, without warning, the figure ran towards her house and leapt through the window!
