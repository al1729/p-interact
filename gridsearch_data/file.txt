As she went about her day, everything seemed to be going according to plan. But then, out of nowhere, she was hit with a wave of luck. First, she found a $20 bill on the ground as she walked to school. Then, during lunchtime, she won the lottery - not just a few dollars either;she won $1 million!

The girl couldn't believe her luck! Suddenly, her boring life had turned into something exciting and full of possibilities. She knew that with this money anything was possible - and she was determined to make the most of it!
