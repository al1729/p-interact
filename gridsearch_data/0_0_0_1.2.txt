The life of a small-town girl only ever seemed to be one of boredom and simplicity. She would wake up each day, do the same things she always did, and go to bed with nothing new having happened. But on this particular day, something was different.
 She woke up feeling excited, as if something great was about to happen. And sure enough, by the time she went to bed that night, her life had changed forever.

The girl had always been a bit of an outsider. She was never quite sure why, but she always felt like she didn't quite fit in with the other kids at school. So when she was approached by the new girl in town, she was more than happy to make a new friend.

The two girls hit it off immediately, and before long they were inseparable. They would spend hours talking and laughing together, and the small-town girl finally felt like she belonged.

Then one day, out of the blue, the new girl told her that she was moving away. The small-town girl was devastated. She didn't know how she was going to go back to her boring, lonely life without her best friend.

But then the new girl gave her a gift. A beautiful necklace with a heart pendant. She told the small-town girl that as long as she wore it, she would always be with her.

And sure enough, from that day forward, the small-town girl never felt alone again. Whenever she missed her friend, she would just look down at the necklace and feel comforted knowing that they were still connected.
