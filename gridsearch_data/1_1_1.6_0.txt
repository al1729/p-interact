The life of a small-town girl only ever seemed to be one of boredom and simplicity. She would wake up each day, do the same things she always did, and go to bed with nothing new having happened. But on this particular day, something was different.
 She woke up feeling more alive than ever before, and she had no idea why.

As she went about her day, she started to notice all the little things that she had always taken for granted. The beauty of the sun shining down on her town, the way the leaves rustled in the wind, and the smile of a stranger passing by. She felt like she was seeing everything for the first time.

Later that day, as she was walking home from school, she heard someone calling her name. She turned around to see one of her old friends from elementary school whom she hadn't seen in years. They caught up with each other and talked for a while about all that had happened in their lives since they last saw each other.
