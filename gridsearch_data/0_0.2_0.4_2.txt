The life of a small-town girl only ever seemed to be one of boredom and simplicity. She would wake up each day, do the same things she always did, and go to bed with nothing new having happened. But on this particular day, something was different.
 She woke up feeling excited, as if something great was about to happen. And sure enough, by the time she went to bed that night, her life had changed forever.

The girl had always been a bit of an outsider. She was never quite sure why, but she always felt like she didn't quite fit in with the other kids at school. So when she was approached by the new girl in town and asked to be friends, she was thrilled. Finally, someone who wanted to be friends with her!

The two girls quickly became inseparable. They would spend all their free time together, talking and laughing until they were both exhausted. The small-town girl had never been so happy. It felt like finally she belonged somewhere.

But then one day, out of the blue, the new girl stopped talking to her. She would completely ignore her when they were at school together, and even though the small-town girl tried reaching out to her, she just couldn't get through. She was heartbroken and lost without her friend.

But then, just when she was starting to lose hope, the new girl came back into her life. She explained that she'd been going through some tough times and needed some space. But now she was ready to pick up where they left off.

And so the two girls resumed their friendship, stronger than ever before. They both knew that they could rely on each other no matter what happened in their lives. And they would never take their friendship for granted again.
