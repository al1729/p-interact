The life of a small-town girl only ever seemed to be one of boredom and simplicity. She would wake up each day, do the same things she always did, and go to bed with nothing new having happened. But on this particular day, something was different.
 She woke up feeling excited, as if something great was about to happen. And sure enough, by the time she went to bed that night, her life had changed forever.

The girl had always been a bit of an outsider. She was never quite sure why, but she always felt like she didn't quite fit in with the other kids at school. So when she was approached by a group of girls who seemed to be planning something exciting, she was more than happy to go along with whatever they had planned.

As it turned out, the girls were planning a prank on one of their classmates - a boy who they all thought was stuck-up and arrogant. The girl wasn't sure if this was something she should be doing, but she decided to go along with it anyway. After all, it would be fun to see the look on his face when he realized he'd been tricked!

The plan went off without a hitch and soon the boy found himself covered in slime from head to toe. The girls laughed and cheered as he stood there humiliated - but the girl couldn't help but feel a little bit sorry for him too. In that moment, she realized that maybe pranking people wasn't really her thing after all.
