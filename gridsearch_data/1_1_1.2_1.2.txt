The life of a small-town girl only ever seemed to be one of boredom and simplicity. She would wake up each day, do the same things she always did, and go to bed with nothing new having happened. But on this particular day, something was different.
 She woke up to a beautiful sun shining in through her window, and she just felt happy. It was as if something had changed inside of her overnight, and she was finally seeing the world for what it really was.

She decided to go for a walk outside, something she rarely did because she always found it so boring. But today, everything looked different. The trees were greener, the sky was bluer, and she even saw a rabbit running around. She smiled to herself and realized that maybe there was more to life than she had originally thought.

As she continued walking, she came across a field of wildflowers. She had never seen anything like it before, and she stopped to smell them. They smelled so sweet and fresh, and they make her feel alive in a way that nothing else ever had. She closed her eyes and let the moment wash over her. When she opened them again,she saw someone walking towards her from the distance..
