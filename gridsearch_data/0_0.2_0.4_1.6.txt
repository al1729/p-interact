The life of a small-town girl only ever seemed to be one of boredom and simplicity. She would wake up each day, do the same things she always did, and go to bed with nothing new having happened. But on this particular day, something was different.
 She woke up feeling as though something exciting was going to happen. And sure enough, by the time she went to bed that night, her life had changed forever.

The girl had always been a bit of an outsider. She was never quite sure why, but she always felt like she didn't quite fit in with the other kids at school. So when she was approached by the new girl in town, she was more than happy to make a friend.

The new girl was different than anyone she had ever met before. She was exciting and full of life. She showed the small-town girl things she had never seen before and introduced her to a world she never knew existed. It was because of this new friend that the small-town girl's life was changed forever.
