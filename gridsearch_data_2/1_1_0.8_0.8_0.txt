The life of a small-town girl only ever seemed to be one of boredom and simplicity. She would wake up each day, do the same things she always did, and go to bed with nothing new having happened. But on this particular day, something was different.
 The girl woke up to find that she had been transformed into a beautiful butterfly. At first, she was scared and didn't know what to do. But then she realized that this was her chance to finally see the world. She spent the day flying around, exploring all the new sights and sounds that she had never experienced before. As the sun began to set, she knew that she would never be able to go back to her old life again. But she was okay with that, because she had finally found something worth living for.
