The life of a small-town girl only ever seemed to be one of boredom and simplicity. She would wake up each day, do the same things she always did, and go to bed with nothing new having happened. But on this particular day, something was different.
 She woke up with a sense of excitement, as if something wonderful was going to happen.

As the day progressed, she began to feel more and more nervous. She had no idea what was making her so anxious, but by the time night fell, she was sure that something life-changing was about to occur. She couldn't have been more wrong.

The next morning, she woke up to find that nothing had happened overnight. It wasn't until later that day that she realized what had actually caused her such anticipation: it was the first day of the rest of her life.
