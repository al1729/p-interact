The life of a small-town girl only ever seemed to be one of boredom and simplicity. She would wake up each day, do the same things she always did, and go to bed with nothing new having happened. But on this particular day, something was different.


As she went about her usual routine, the girl couldn’t help but feel like something was off. She couldn’t quite put her finger on it, but there was definitely something different in the air. And sure enough, by the time she got to bed that night, she realized what it was: today, for the first time ever, nothing had happened.
