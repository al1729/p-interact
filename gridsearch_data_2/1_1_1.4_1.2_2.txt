The life of a small-town girl only ever seemed to be one of boredom and simplicity. She would wake up each day, do the same things she always did, and go to bed with nothing new having happened. But on this particular day, something was different.
 She woke up feeling as though something wonderful was about to happen. She couldn't explain it, but she just knew that today was going to be special.

As the day went on, she began to feel more and more excitement building inside of her. By the time evening came, she could barely contain herself. She hurried through her dinner and then ran outside to see if anything was happening. And sure enough, there in the sky were the most beautiful fireworks she had ever seen! They lit up the whole sky with their colours and sparks, and she couldn't help but dance around in delight. It was definitely the most exciting thing that had ever happened to her.
