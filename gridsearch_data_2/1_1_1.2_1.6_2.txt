The life of a small-town girl only ever seemed to be one of boredom and simplicity. She would wake up each day, do the same things she always did, and go to bed with nothing new having happened. But on this particular day, something was different.
 She woke up, got dressed, and went outside to find that the whole world had changed. The sky was now a deep blue, the sun was a bright pink, and the grass was a vibrant green. Even her small town seemed different; it was as if she were seeing it for the first time. She didn't know what had happened, but she knew that this was going to be the best day ever.
