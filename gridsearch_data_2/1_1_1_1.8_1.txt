The life of a small-town girl only ever seemed to be one of boredom and simplicity. She would wake up each day, do the same things she always did, and go to bed with nothing new having happened. But on this particular day, something was different.
 She woke up feeling oddly excited, as if something wonderful was about to happen. And sure enough, when she looked out her window, there was a beautiful rainbow in the sky. She had never seen anything so beautiful before and she felt compelled to go outside and investigate.

She walked down the street, admiring the colors of the rainbow as they danced in front of her. Suddenly, she heard a voice calling her name. It sounded like it was coming from the other side of the rainbow. Without thinking any further, she started running towards it. As she got closer, she could see a figure standing on the other side of the colorful arc. It was a girl about her own age and she looked just as excited to see our protagonist as our protagonist was to see her.

Without saying a word, they both reached out and grabbed each other's hands. And in that instant, they both knew that this was going to be the best day ever.
