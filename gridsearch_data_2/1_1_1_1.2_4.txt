The life of a small-town girl only ever seemed to be one of boredom and simplicity. She would wake up each day, do the same things she always did, and go to bed with nothing new having happened. But on this particular day, something was different.
 She woke up, got dressed, ate breakfast, and walked out the door to begin her day. But as soon as she stepped outside, she was transportated to a new place. It was like nothing she'd ever seen before; bright colors, interesting people. She didn't know what was happening, but she knew that this was going to be the best day of her life.
