The life of a small-town girl only ever seemed to be one of boredom and simplicity. She would wake up each day, do the same things she always did, and go to bed with nothing new having happened. But on this particular day, something was different.
 As she left her house to go on her daily walk, she saw a sign that read "Enter the Forest if you dare". She had never seen this sign before, and was instantly intrigued. She knew that she shouldn't go in, as it was probably dangerous, but she couldn't help herself. She had to know what was inside.

As she ventured deeper and deeper into the forest, she began to notice strange things happening. The trees were talking to her, the animals were following her, and the light seemed to be getting dimmer and dimmer. She tried to turn back, but it was like something was pulling her in. Eventually, she came to a clearing in the center of the forest, and there in the middle sat an old woman. The woman warned her not to come any closer, but the girl didn't listen. She wanted to know what was going on.

The woman told her that she was in danger and needed to leave immediately, but again the girl didn't listen. She asked the woman what was going on, and why she was being followed by animals and talked to by trees. The woman looked at her with a sad expression and said,"You're different than most people; you have the ability to see things that others can't see. That's why they're after you." Just then, a group of men burst into the clearing with weapons drawn. The old woman pushed the girl away and said,"Run!"

The girl did as she was told and ran as fast as she could out of the forest. Once she made it back home safely, she looked back at theForest with a new appreciation for life itself. Even though it might be boring sometimes, it was certainly better than whatever awaited her inside those woods....
