The life of a small-town girl only ever seemed to be one of boredom and simplicity. She would wake up each day, do the same things she always did, and go to bed with nothing new having happened. But on this particular day, something was different.
 It started with a knock on her door.

She answered it to find a delivery man holding a large box. He told her it was for her and handed it over before hurrying off. She brought the box inside and placed it on her coffee table, wondering what could be inside.

Curious, she opened it up to find a beautiful dress inside. It was exactly her size and style. She knew there was no way this could be a coincidence - someone must have sent this to her specifically. But who? And why?

There was only one way to find out. She slipped into the dress and looked in the mirror, feeling like a brand new person. Then she went outside, determined to figure out who had sent her this gift and why..
