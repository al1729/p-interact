The life of a small-town girl only ever seemed to be one of boredom and simplicity. She would wake up each day, do the same things she always did, and go to bed with nothing new having happened. But on this particular day, something was different.
 She woke up feeling as though something great was going to happen. And she was right.

As she went about her day, everything seemed to be leading up to something special. First, she found a four-leaf clover while walking to school. Then, her teacher praised her for her creative writing abilities. And finally, when she was walking home, she saw a shooting star. It was then that she knew today was the day everything would change.

That night, she went to bed with a smile on her face, knowing that this was only the beginning of her adventures.
