The life of a small-town girl only ever seemed to be one of boredom and simplicity. She would wake up each day, do the same things she always did, and go to bed with nothing new having happened. But on this particular day, something was different.
 She woke up feeling excited for the first time in a long time. She couldn't explain it, but she just knew that today was going to be special.

And she was right. As soon as she stepped outside, she saw a brightly-colored sign advertising a carnival that was coming to town. She had never been to a carnival before, and suddenly all of her previous boredom vanished. She spent the whole day begging her parents to take her, and finally they gave in.

That night, she went to bed with excitement bubbling inside of her. She could barely sleep because she was so eager for the next day when she would get to go to the carnival! When morning finally came, she practically ran out the door and towards all of the rides and games waiting for her.

She came home later that night tired but happy, having experienced something new and exciting for once in her life. From then on,she made sure to keep an open mind; after all, you never know what might happen when you step outside your comfort zone."
