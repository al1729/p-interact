The life of a small-town girl only ever seemed to be one of boredom and simplicity. She would wake up each day, do the same things she always did, and go to bed with nothing new having happened. But on this particular day, something was different.
 She woke up earlier than usual and decided to take a walk into the forest that bordered her town. She had never ventured in before, but for some reason, today felt like the day to do it.

As she walked deeper and deeper into the woods, she began to feel as though she was being watched. She turned around, but saw nothing but trees. She shrugged it off and kept walking until she came across a clearing. And in the center of that clearing was a beautiful deer. The deer gazed at her with its gentle eyes and she felt a sudden sense of peace wash over her. In that moment, she realized that there was so much more to life than just the mundane things she did everyday. There was magic and wonder waiting for her if she just took the time to find it.
