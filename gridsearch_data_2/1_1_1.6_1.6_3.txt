The life of a small-town girl only ever seemed to be one of boredom and simplicity. She would wake up each day, do the same things she always did, and go to bed with nothing new having happened. But on this particular day, something was different.
 She woke up feeling excitement for the first time in her life. She couldn't explain it, but she knew that something special was going to happen.

As the day went on, she felt her anticipation grow. By afternoon, she was sure that whatever was going to happen would occur during that evening's town festival. Her heart raced as she thought about all of the possibilities. Could it be a romantic encounter? A dance under the stars? Or something even more magical?

She didn't have to wait long to find out. As soon as night fell, she found herself being drawn towards the town square. And there, in front of everyone, she saw him. He was unlike anyone she'd ever seen before - handsome, charming and mysterious. They locked eyes for a moment and suddenly, SHE KNEW. This was meant to be; they were destined to meet each other and fall in love."
