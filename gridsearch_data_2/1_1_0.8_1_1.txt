The life of a small-town girl only ever seemed to be one of boredom and simplicity. She would wake up each day, do the same things she always did, and go to bed with nothing new having happened. But on this particular day, something was different.
 The girl woke up to the sound of something banging on her window. She got out of bed and slowly made her way to the window, wondering what could be making the noise. When she looked outside, she saw a large, black bird perched on her windowsill. The bird stared at her with its bright, red eyes and then flew away.

The girl was so intrigued by this mysterious event that she decided to follow the bird. She followed it through the streets of her town and into the woods beyond. She had never ventured into the woods before, but she felt drawn to them now. As she walked deeper into the woods, she began to feel as though she were being watched. And then, suddenly, someone grabbed her from behind!

The man who had grabbed her was covered in dirt and had a wild look in his eyes. The girl screamed, but he put his hand over her mouth to stop her from making any noise. He told her that he was sorry for grabbing her but that he needed her help. He explained that he was lost and didn't know how to get back to his home. The girl felt sympathy for him and agreed to help him find his way back.

After a few hours of walking, they finally arrived at a small cabin in the woods. The man opened the door and went inside, motioning for the girl to follow him. Once they were both inside, he locked the door behind them. The girl looked around warily, wondering what kind of place this was. Suddenly, she heard a noise coming from upstairs...
