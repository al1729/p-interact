The life of a small-town girl only ever seemed to be one of boredom and simplicity. She would wake up each day, do the same things she always did, and go to bed with nothing new having happened. But on this particular day, something was different.
 She woke up feeling excited, as if something great was going to happen. And sure enough, by the time she went to bed that night, her life had changed forever.

The day started like any other, but the girl just couldn't shake the feeling that something special was going to happen. She went about her usual routine, but with a sense of anticipation in her heart. As she went through her day, she started to notice all of the little things that were different from normal. The sky was a brighter blue than usual, the sun seemed to be shining just for her, and even the birds seemed to be singing a happy tune.

By the time evening came around, the girl was convinced that something amazing was about to happen. She went to bed with a smile on her face and fell asleep dreaming of all of the wonderful possibilities for tomorrow. 

The next morning she woke up early and couldn't wait to start her day. She ran outside and found that it was snowing! It wasn't just any snow either - it was sparkling and glittering in the sunlight. She laughed and scooped up a handful before running back inside to tell her mom what had happened overnight. From then on, that small-town girl's life would never be boring or simple again - because now she knew that anything is possible if you believe it is.
