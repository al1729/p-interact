The life of a small-town girl only ever seemed to be one of boredom and simplicity. She would wake up each day, do the same things she always did, and go to bed with nothing new having happened. But on this particular day, something was different.
 She could feel it in the air; something was about to happen.

She went about her day as normal, but she couldn't help but feel that there was something waiting for her, just around the corner. And sure enough, as she turned the corner into her street, she saw it. A big red balloon, floating down from the sky and coming towards her.

She ran to catch it, and as she did, she felt a sudden surge of happiness and excitement coursing through her veins. She knew this was going to be a good day.
