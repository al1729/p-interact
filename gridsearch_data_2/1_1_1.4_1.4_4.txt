The life of a small-town girl only ever seemed to be one of boredom and simplicity. She would wake up each day, do the same things she always did, and go to bed with nothing new having happened. But on this particular day, something was different.
 The girl woke up to find that her town had been transformed into a bustling metropolis overnight.

The girl couldn't believe her eyes as she walked through the streets that were now filled with people and cars. She had never seen anything like it before. She didn't know what to make of it, but she was excited for the adventure that was sure to come her way.
