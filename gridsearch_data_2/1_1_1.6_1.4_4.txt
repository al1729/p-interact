The life of a small-town girl only ever seemed to be one of boredom and simplicity. She would wake up each day, do the same things she always did, and go to bed with nothing new having happened. But on this particular day, something was different.
 She could feel it in the air.

As she went about her usual routine, she couldn’t help but notice that there was something different about today. It was as if the world around her was more vibrant and alive than it had ever been before. She didn’t know what to make of it, but she knew that whatever was happening, it felt good.

She finished her chores and decided to go for a walk into town. As she walked, she ended up at the edge of a forest that she had never seen before. She hesitated for a moment, unsure of whether or not she should enter, but eventually curiosity got the better of her and she stepped into the woods.

As soon as she did,she felt likeshe had been transported to another world entirely. The trees were taller than anyshe had evershe seen before,and there seemed to be an ethereal qualityto everything aroundher .
