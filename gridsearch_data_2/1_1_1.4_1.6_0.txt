The life of a small-town girl only ever seemed to be one of boredom and simplicity. She would wake up each day, do the same things she always did, and go to bed with nothing new having happened. But on this particular day, something was different.
 She woke up feeling energized and excited, as if something great was about to happen. And sure enough, by the time she went to bed that night, her life had changed forever.

She had always loved going for walks in the woods near her home, so that's where she headed first thing in the morning. But today, instead of taking the same path she always took, she decided to explore a new one. After a few minutes of walking, she came across a clearing that she had never seen before. In the center of the clearing was a beautiful tree with shining leaves. It looked like it was calling out to her, so she walked over and put her hand on its trunk. As soon as she did,she felt a surge of energy coursing through her body. She knew then that this tree was special and it would change her life forever.
