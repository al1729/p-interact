The life of a small-town girl only ever seemed to be one of boredom and simplicity. She would wake up each day, do the same things she always did, and go to bed with nothing new having happened. But on this particular day, something was different.
 She woke up feeling strangely excited, as if something great were about to happen. And sure enough, when she went outside, she found a golden ticket lying on the ground. With it came a note saying that she had been chosen to come and visit Willy Wonka's chocolate factory. She could hardly believe her luck!

The girl wasted no time in getting ready and set off on her journey. She was amazed by all the sights and sounds of the factory, and even more amazed by Wonka himself. He was so kind and generous, giving her free reign of his wonderful creation. She left the factory with a newfound appreciation for life itself...and for chocolate!
