The life of a small-town girl only ever seemed to be one of boredom and simplicity. She would wake up each day, do the same things she always did, and go to bed with nothing new having happened. But on this particular day, something was different.

She leapt out of bed and ran outside, where she saw the most beautiful rainbow she had ever seen. It was then that she realized that anything is possible if you just believe it can happen.
