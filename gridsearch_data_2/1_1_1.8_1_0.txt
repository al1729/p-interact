The life of a small-town girl only ever seemed to be one of boredom and simplicity. She would wake up each day, do the same things she always did, and go to bed with nothing new having happened. But on this particular day, something was different.
 She woke up feeling as if something exciting was going to happen. And sure enough, by the time she went to bed that night, her life had changed forever.

She started her day like usual, getting ready for school and eating breakfast with her parents. But as she left for school, she noticed a strange light in the sky. It seemed to be getting closer and closer! She ran back into the house to tell her parents about it, but by the time they got outside, the light was gone. They couldn't explain what it was, but something told her that it meant something big was about to happen.

Sure enough, later that day when she came home from school there was a large crowd of people gathered in front of her house. She pushed through them to see what was going on and saw two men carrying a large box inside. Her curiosity got the best of her and she followed them inside only to find out that they were delivering a brand new television set! It had been ordered especially for her family - how could they have known? - and it would change their lives forever
