The life of a small-town girl only ever seemed to be one of boredom and simplicity. She would wake up each day, do the same things she always did, and go to bed with nothing new having happened. But on this particular day, something was different.
 Even the air felt different.

As she went about her day, she began to notice more and more strange things happening. People were acting stranger than usual, the animals were behaving oddly, and even the weather seemed to be changing. By the time night fell, she was sure that something was definitely going on.

She didn't know what it was, but whatever it was, she knew that it was big. Something important was happening, and she had a feeling that she was going to be a part of it somehow.
