The life of a small-town girl only ever seemed to be one of boredom and simplicity. She would wake up each day, do the same things she always did, and go to bed with nothing new having happened. But on this particular day, something was different.
 She woke up feeling unusually excited for some reason, and she couldn't quite figure out why. As she went about her day, she began to notice more and more things that were different. The way the sun was shining, the way the birds were singing; it all felt new to her. By the time night had fallen, she was sure that something amazing was going to happen. She didn't know what it was, but she could feel it in her bones.

Sure enough, something incredible did happen. She met a boy who would change her life forever. He was unlike anyone she'd ever met before; he was exciting and interesting and made her feel things she'd never felt before. They talked until the early hours of the morning, and when they parted ways, she knew that her life would never be the same again. From that day forward, everything seemed brighter and more wonderful than it ever had before. She was finally happy, and she had this boy to thank for it.
