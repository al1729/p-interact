The life of a small-town girl only ever seemed to be one of boredom and simplicity. She would wake up each day, do the same things she always did, and go to bed with nothing new having happened. But on this particular day, something was different.
 She woke up feeling like something exciting was about to happen. She couldn't explain it, but she just knew.

As she went about her day, she felt a sense of anticipation growing within her. By the time evening came, she was practically buzzing with excitement. She had no idea what was going to happen, but whatever it was, she knew it would be great.

The night passed slowly, but eventually the girl fell asleep. And when she awoke the next morning, she found that her prediction had come true; something wonderful had happened overnight. The small-town girl's life was forever changed and she would never again feel bored or content with simplicity.
