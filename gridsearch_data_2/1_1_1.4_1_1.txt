The life of a small-town girl only ever seemed to be one of boredom and simplicity. She would wake up each day, do the same things she always did, and go to bed with nothing new having happened. But on this particular day, something was different.
 She woke up with a sense of anticipation, as if something big was about to happen. And sure enough, by the end of the day she had the thrill of a lifetime.

She had always loved going on adventures, exploring new places and meeting new people. So when she got the opportunity to do all of that and more, she jumped at it. The next thing she knew she was on a plane headed for an exotic location. She couldn't believe her luck!

The girl spent the next few days in awe of her surroundings; everything was so different from what she was used to back home. She made new friends and tried things she never would have thought possible before. It was an experience unlike anything else she'd ever had, and one that would stay with her forever.
