The life of a small-town girl only ever seemed to be one of boredom and simplicity. She would wake up each day, do the same things she always did, and go to bed with nothing new having happened. But on this particular day, something was different.
 She woke up to the sound of rain pattering on her window and a sense of excitement in the air. She leapt out of bed and ran to look outside, barely containing her happiness at the sight of the grey sky and wet streets.

For the first time in as long as she could remember, she was excited for what the day might bring. She got dressed quickly and rushed downstairs, eagerly anticipating whatever adventure awaited her. As she stepped outside, she felt a sense of freedom and possibility that she had never felt before.oday was going to be different; today was going to be special. And she was going to make sure of it.
