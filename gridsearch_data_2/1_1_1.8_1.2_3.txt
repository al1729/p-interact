The life of a small-town girl only ever seemed to be one of boredom and simplicity. She would wake up each day, do the same things she always did, and go to bed with nothing new having happened. But on this particular day, something was different.
 She woke up feeling strangely excited, as if something great was about to happen. And sure enough, by the time she went to bed that night, her life had changed forever.

The girl had always been a bit of an outsider in her town. She was too shy to make many friends and spent most of her time alone. So when she met the new boy in town, she was immediately interested. He was different from anyone she'd ever talked to before and seemed just as lonely as she was. They quickly became friends, spending all their free time together.

Then one day, out of nowhere, he kissed her. It took her by surprise but she realized that she liked it. From then on they were officially a couple and everyone in town knew it. The small-town girl suddenly found herself with a boyfriend who made every day exciting and new."
