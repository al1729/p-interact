The life of a small-town girl only ever seemed to be one of boredom and simplicity. She would wake up each day, do the same things she always did, and go to bed with nothing new having happened. But on this particular day, something was different.


As she went about her day, she noticed that everyone around her was acting strange. They were all walking around with their heads down, not looking at anyone else. It was as if they were each in their own little world, lost in thought.

The small-town girl tried to focus on her own tasks, but she couldn't help but wonder what could be going on. Eventually, she couldn't take it anymore and decided to ask one of her neighbors what was wrong.

"It's the end of the world," the neighbor replied solemnly. "We're all going to die."

The small-town girl didn't know what to say. She had heard about the end of the world before, but it had always seemed like something that would happen to other people, in a far-off place. She never thought it would happen to her and her town.

But now, it seemed like it was really happening. The sky was darkening and there was a sense of foreboding in the air. The small-town girl knew that whatever was coming, it wasn't going to be good.
