The life of a small-town girl only ever seemed to be one of boredom and simplicity. She would wake up each day, do the same things she always did, and go to bed with nothing new having happened. But on this particular day, something was different.
 The girl woke up with a feeling that today was going to be special.

As she went about her day, everything seemed to confirm that this was indeed the case. Small things, like the fact that she found a dollar on the ground, or that people were smiling at her more than usual. It all added up to something big happening, and by the time night fell, the girl was sure of it.

Sure enough, as she was getting ready for bed, there was a knock at her door. When she answered it, she found a beautiful golden retriever standing before her with a note attached to his collar. The note said simply "Enjoy your new best friend!" And with that, the girl's life changed forever. From then on, every day held something new and exciting for her - all becauseshe had been open to possibility and believedthat today could be different from any other day."
