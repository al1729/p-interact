The life of a small-town girl only ever seemed to be one of boredom and simplicity. She would wake up each day, do the same things she always did, and go to bed with nothing new having happened. But on this particular day, something was different.


She woke up to the sound of birds chirping outside her window and the sun shining in, casting a warm glow on everything in the room. She felt different, like something exciting was about to happen. And sure enough, when she went downstairs and stepped outside, she saw a magnificent butterfly fluttering around her doorstep.

She had never seen anything so beautiful in all her life. She watched it for a while as it danced around in the sunlight before finally deciding to follow it. The butterfly led her on an adventure through fields and forests, past rivers and streams, until they came to a hill that overlooked the most incredible sight she had ever seen - an entire city glittering in the distance.

The girlstood there for a moment, mesmerized by the scene before her. Then she turned back to see that the butterfly was gone; but she didn't mind because now she knew that there was more to life than just boredom and simplicity - there was magic too.
