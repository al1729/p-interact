The life of a small-town girl only ever seemed to be one of boredom and simplicity. She would wake up each day, do the same things she always did, and go to bed with nothing new having happened. But on this particular day, something was different.


The girl woke up to the sound of birds chirping outside her window. It was a beautiful day, and she couldn't help but feel excited for what was to come. She got dressed and went downstairs, where she found her mother in the kitchen.

"Good morning, sweetie," her mother said as she kissed her on the forehead. "Today is going to be a great day."

The girl smiled and nodded, eating breakfast quickly so that she could go outside and explore. She had always loved adventure, even if it only existed in her own backyard. But today, something was calling her further than that.
She walked down Main Street, greeting people as she went by. Everyone seemed to be in a good mood today, which only made the girl feel more excited about whatever it was that was going to happen. 
As she turned the corner onto Elm Street, someone ran into her and knocked her down onto the ground.
