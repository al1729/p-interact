The life of a small-town girl only ever seemed to be one of boredom and simplicity. She would wake up each day, do the same things she always did, and go to bed with nothing new having happened. But on this particular day, something was different.


As she left her house to go about her day, she noticed a bright light in the sky. It was so strange and out of place that she couldn't help but stare at it. She watched as it got closer and closer until it was right above her. Then, before she knew what was happening, she was lifted off the ground into the light!

She found herself in a beautiful garden, surrounded by unfamiliar yet somehow friendly faces. They welcomed her warmly and told her that she had been chosen to be their queen. Thoughshe didn't quite understand what was going on, she went along with it for now. After all, it wasn't everyday that something this exciting happened in her boring little town!
