The life of a small-town girl only ever seemed to be one of boredom and simplicity. She would wake up each day, do the same things she always did, and go to bed with nothing new having happened. But on this particular day, something was different.
 She woke up feeling excited, as if something special was going to happen. And sure enough, by the time she went to bed that night, her life had changed forever.

Shefirst noticed it when shegot out of bed. Normally, she would just stagger out onto the cold floor and feel the need to put her slippers on immediately. But today, she felt different. She actually enjoyed the sensation of the cold floor on her feet and took a moment to just stand there and feel it. Then she made her way downstairs and into the kitchen, where she found a note from her mother saying that breakfast was already on the table. This was strange; her mother never cooked breakfast for her before heading off to work.

As ateher breakfast,she began to feel more and more curious about what was going on. Was this some sort of special day? If so, why hadn't anyone told her about it? She quickly finished her meal and then decided to go outside and see if anything looked different there.

At first glance, everything seemed normal - but then she noticed that the flowers in the garden were blooming more brightly than usual and the birds were singing louder than normal too. She walked down the street towards town, taking in all of the sights and sounds around her. As she got closer to town, she could hear people talking excitedly - but about what? She quickened her pace until she reached Main Street where a large crowd had gathered.
