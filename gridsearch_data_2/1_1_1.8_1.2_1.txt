The life of a small-town girl only ever seemed to be one of boredom and simplicity. She would wake up each day, do the same things she always did, and go to bed with nothing new having happened. But on this particular day, something was different.
 She woke up feeling nervous, as if something big was about to happen. And sure enough, when she left her house to go into town, she saw a sign that said "The End of the World is Today!"

She didn't know what to make of it at first, but soon enough the whole town was in a panic. People were packing their bags and getting ready to leave, all while trying to figure out where they would go and how they would survive. Our protagonist knew that she couldn't just sit around and wait for the end - she had to do something.
