The life of a small-town girl only ever seemed to be one of boredom and simplicity. She would wake up each day, do the same things she always did, and go to bed with nothing new having happened. But on this particular day, something was different.
 She woke up feeling as though something exciting was going to happen. And sure enough, by the time she went to bed that night, her life had changed forever.

She had always been a good student, but today she just couldn't seem to focus in class. Her mind kept wandering off thinking about what could be waiting for her outside of school. She daydreamed about adventures and new places and things she had never experienced before. It was all so thrilling! When the final bell rang signaling the end of the school day, she practically flew out of her seat and raced out of the building. She didn't even wait for her friends like she usually did; she just wanted to get home and see what was waiting for her.

As soon as she got home, she ran to her room and threw open the door... only to find nothing there except her empty bedroom exactly how she left it that morning. Deflated, she flopped down onto her bed wondering what could have possibly made today feel so different if nothing actually happened? Maybe tomorrow would be better...
