The life of a small-town girl only ever seemed to be one of boredom and simplicity. She would wake up each day, do the same things she always did, and go to bed with nothing new having happened. But on this particular day, something was different.
 She woke up feeling as though something exciting was going to happen. And sure enough, by the end of the day, her life had changed forever.

It all started when she heard a knock on her door early in the morning. She opened it to find a delivery man with a package for her. He said it was from a secret admirer and that she should open it right away. She eagerly took the package and went back inside, closing the door behind her. Her hands trembled as she slowly opened it, revealing a beautiful necklace inside.Attached to the necklace was a note that said "Wear this tonight and meet me at the old abandoned house at 8pm."

She didn't know who this person was, but she knew that she wanted to meet them. So, at 8pm sharp, she made her way to the old abandoned house outside of town. When she arrived, there was no one there except for a small black cat that ran off into some bushes nearby. Suddenly, out of nowhere, someone grabbed her from behind and covered her mouth so she couldn't scream. Terrified, she struggled to free herself but eventually gave up when they threatened to hurt her if she didn't calm down.. When they released their grip on her mouth slightly,she begged themto lethergoandthattheshewouldnottelly anyone about what happened . They agreed but only ifshekept quiteabouttheirencounter . 


The girl never told anyone about what happened that night and vowed to keep it a secret foreverâ€¦until now
