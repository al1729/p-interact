The life of a small-town girl only ever seemed to be one of boredom and simplicity. She would wake up each day, do the same things she always did, and go to bed with nothing new having happened. But on this particular day, something was different.
 She woke up feeling as though something amazing was about to happen. She couldn't explain it, but she just knew that today was going to be special.

As the day went on, she started to feel more and more excited. By the time evening came, she was practically bursting with anticipation. She didn't know what was going to happen, but she knew it would be wonderful.

And then, suddenly, it happened. The most incredible thing she could have ever imagined. It was perfect, and everything felt right in the world. She had finally found her purpose in life - and it was something that she never would have expected.
