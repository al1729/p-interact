The life of a small-town girl only ever seemed to be one of boredom and simplicity. She would wake up each day, do the same things she always did, and go to bed with nothing new having happened. But on this particular day, something was different.
 She woke up feeling exciting and full of energy, as if something amazing was about to happen.

She hastily got dressed and ran out the door, not even stopping to eat breakfast. She had no idea where she was going or what she was looking for, but she didn't care. She felt alive for the first time in her life and nothing was going to stop her from experiencing whatever it was that was waiting for her.

She wandered through the streets, taking in the sights and sounds of the town she thought she knew so well but now seemed so different. She didn't know where she was going, but somehow she ended up at the edge of town, where the forest began. She had never ventured into the Forest before, as it was said to be dangerous, but now she felt like nothing could hurt her.

She walked deeper and deeper into the woods, losing track of time as she went. Suddenly, she came across a small clearing with a beautiful butterfly perched on a flower. It seemed to be beckoning her closer, so she cautiously approached it. As she got nearer, the butterfly opened its wings to reveal a brilliant blue light. Mesmerized by this strange sight, she took another step closer...and then everything went dark.
