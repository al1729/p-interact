The life of a small-town girl only ever seemed to be one of boredom and simplicity. She would wake up each day, do the same things she always did, and go to bed with nothing new having happened. But on this particular day, something was different.
 She woke up feeling excited for the first time in years, not knowing why but eager to start her day. She went about her usual routine, getting ready for school and doing her chores, but with a new sense of enthusiasm. Even class was interesting today as she paid attention and took part in the lessons instead of daydreaming out the window. When she got home, she completed her homework quickly and without complaint. Then, she sat down at the kitchen table to write a letter to her best friend. In it, she poured out her heart about how happy she felt and how grateful she was for this sudden change. It seemed that everything was going right for once. The next day, however, things were back to normal again and the girl couldn't help but feel disappointed. though maybe it wasn't so bad after all; at least now she had something to look forward to."
