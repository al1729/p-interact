The life of a small-town girl only ever seemed to be one of boredom and simplicity. She would wake up each day, do the same things she always did, and go to bed with nothing new having happened. But on this particular day, something was different.
 She woke up feeling as though something exciting was going to happen. And sure enough, by the time lunchtime rolled around, her life had changed forever.

The girl had been walking through the park when she saw a wanted poster for a local bandit who had been terrorizing the town. She knew that if she could capture him and bring him to justice, she would be hailed as a hero. So without hesitation, she set out to find him.

She tracked him down to an old abandoned cabin in the woods outside of town. When she confronted him, he tried to run away but she was faster and caught up with him easily. She tied him up and took him back into town where the sheriff were waiting to take him away.

The small-town girl had saved her community from a dangerous criminal and finally felt like she belonged somewhere. From then on, her life was full of excitement and adventure as people looked up to her as their own personal hero
