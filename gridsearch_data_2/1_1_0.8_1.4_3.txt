The life of a small-town girl only ever seemed to be one of boredom and simplicity. She would wake up each day, do the same things she always did, and go to bed with nothing new having happened. But on this particular day, something was different.
 The girl woke up, and she felt like something exciting was going to happen. She couldn't explain it, but she just had a feeling.

As the day went on, the girl's excitement only grew. She went about her business as usual, but with an extra spring in her step. She couldn't wait to see what was going to happen.

And then, at last, it happened. The girl heard a knock on her door, and when she opened it, there was a man there with a big grin on his face. He handed her an envelope and said, "You've won!" The girl could hardly believe it as she tore open the envelope to find that she'd won a free trip to Paris!

She immediately started packing her bags, and within hours she was on a plane headed for the City of Lights. It was everything she'd ever dreamed of, and more. She wandered the streets in awe of the sights and sounds, sampled delicious French food, and even found herself falling in love with a handsome stranger.

It was the best day of her life, and one that she would never forget.
