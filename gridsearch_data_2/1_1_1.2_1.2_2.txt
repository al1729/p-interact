The life of a small-town girl only ever seemed to be one of boredom and simplicity. She would wake up each day, do the same things she always did, and go to bed with nothing new having happened. But on this particular day, something was different.


As she left her house to go about her day, she noticed a Dragonfly hovering nearby. It was a beautiful creature, and she had never seen one up close before. She cautiously approached it, not wanting to scare it away, and when she got close enough she reached out to touch it.

To her amazement, the Dragonfly didn't fly away. It seemed to like being petted, and so she stroked its delicate wings as it sat on her finger. She smiled and felt happy for this moment of connection with something new and exciting.
