The life of a small-town girl only ever seemed to be one of boredom and simplicity. She would wake up each day, do the same things she always did, and go to bed with nothing new having happened. But on this particular day, something was different.
 The girl woke up to a world that was asleep. The streets were empty and the sky was dark. It was as if everyone had just suddenly disappeared.
The girl walked around her town, wondering where everyone could be. She went to the grocery store and the library, but they were both deserted. She even tried going to her best friend's house, but it was clear that she wasn't there either. Wherever everyone was, they weren't in this town anymore.
The girl decides to leave her small town in search of answers. She packs a few things and sets off into the unknown. After walking for hours, she comes across a sign that reads "Welcome to the City." She has never been to this city before, but it seems like as good of a place as any to start looking for people.
As she enters the city, she is greeted by billboards and towering buildings. This place is nothing like her small town; it's loud and bustling with activity. The girl starts asking people if they've seen her friends or family, but no one seems to know anything about them.She eventually finds herself at a police station, where she learns that the entire world is asleep!
