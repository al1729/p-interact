The life of a small-town girl only ever seemed to be one of boredom and simplicity. She would wake up each day, do the same things she always did, and go to bed with nothing new having happened. But on this particular day, something was different.
 She could feel it in the air.

As she went about her usual routine, she couldn’t help but notice the strange looks people were giving her. It was as if they knew something she didn’t. She tried to shake off the feeling, but by the time she got to school, she was on edge.

All through first period, she felt like everyone was watching her. And when the bell rang for second period, she was sure of it. As she walked into the classroom, all eyes were on her. And then someone started clapping slowly. Soon enough, the whole room was applauding her.

Confused and embarrassed, she turned to look at the teacher, only to see that he too was applauding her. “What’s going on?” She asked him helplessly.

With a smile, he simply replied “You finally did it! Congratulations!”
