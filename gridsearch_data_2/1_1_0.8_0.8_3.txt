The life of a small-town girl only ever seemed to be one of boredom and simplicity. She would wake up each day, do the same things she always did, and go to bed with nothing new having happened. But on this particular day, something was different.
 She woke up to the sound of birds chirping outside her window and the sun shining in through the curtains. She jumped out of bed, ran downstairs, and burst out the front door to see what was happening.

Everything was covered in a blanket of snow. The trees, the ground, even the air seemed to shimmer with cold. She had never seen anything like it before. She wanted to touch it, to feel its fragile beauty, but she knew she couldn't. It would be gone soon enough, and she didn't want to miss a moment of it. So she just stood there, watching as the world around her transformed into something magical.
