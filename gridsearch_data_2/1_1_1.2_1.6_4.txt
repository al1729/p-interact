The life of a small-town girl only ever seemed to be one of boredom and simplicity. She would wake up each day, do the same things she always did, and go to bed with nothing new having happened. But on this particular day, something was different.
 She woke up with a spring in her step, and she had a plan.

Today was the day that she was going to change her life. She was going to do something different, something exciting. And so she set out on her adventure....

The small-town girl walked for hours, until she reached the edge of town. She had never been this far before, and she felt like anything was possible. As she continued walking, she saw a sign for a carnival that was in town for just one more day. She had always wanted to go to a carnival, and today seemed like the perfect opportunity.

Without hesitating, she bought a ticket and walked through the gates. For the first time in her life, she felt truly alive. She rode every ride, ate all of the food, and played all of the games. It was amazing! And when it came time to leave, she didn't want to go home. She wanted to stay at the carnival forever.
