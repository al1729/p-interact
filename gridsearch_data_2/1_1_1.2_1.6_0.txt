The life of a small-town girl only ever seemed to be one of boredom and simplicity. She would wake up each day, do the same things she always did, and go to bed with nothing new having happened. But on this particular day, something was different.
 She woke up to the sound of rain pattering against her window, which was strange because it wasn't supposed to rain for another week. She decided to go back to sleep, but found that she couldn't. The rain continued to fall and soon turned into a downpour.

She got out of bed and went to look out the window. Her small town was flooded with water! She had never seen anything like it in her life. She quickly got dressed and ran outside, wanting to see more of this amazing natural phenomenon. But as she stepped outside, she realized that something else was different about this day. It wasn't just the weather; everything looked new and unfamiliar. She didn't know where she was or what had happened to her small town overnight!
