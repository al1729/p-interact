The life of a small-town girl only ever seemed to be one of boredom and simplicity. She would wake up each day, do the same things she always did, and go to bed with nothing new having happened. But on this particular day, something was different.
 She woke up feeling as if something exciting was about to happen. And sure enough, by the time she went to bed that night, her life had changed forever.

The girl spent her day doing the things she always did, but with a sense of anticipation in her heart. She knew something special was going to happen, and she couldn't wait to find out what it was. As the day went on, the feeling only grew stronger. By the time evening came, she was bursting with excitement.

And then, just as she was about to go to bed, it happened. There was a knock at her door, and when she opened it, she saw a tall stranger standing there. He told her he'd been sent from another town - one that wasn't so boring and simple - and he asked if she wanted to come with him. The girl didn't hesitate for a second; she packed her bags and followed him out into the night without looking back once.
