The life of a small-town girl only ever seemed to be one of boredom and simplicity. She would wake up each day, do the same things she always did, and go to bed with nothing new having happened. But on this particular day, something was different.
 She woke up with a sense of excitement, as if something amazing was going to happen. And sure enough, it did.

As she went about her day, she saw more and more signs that this was going to be a special day. She found a lucky penny on the street and her favorite song came on the radio. She even won a free ticket to the movies from a contest at the local store. All of these things made her feel like something wonderful was about to occur.

And then, in the evening, it finally happened: she met the love of her life. He was everything she had ever dreamed of and more; kind, handsome, funny, and charming. They talked for hours upon hours that night, until they finally parted ways with promises to meet again soon. From that moment on, she knew that her life would never be boring or simple again - because now she had someone worth living for."
