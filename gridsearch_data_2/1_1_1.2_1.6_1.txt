The life of a small-town girl only ever seemed to be one of boredom and simplicity. She would wake up each day, do the same things she always did, and go to bed with nothing new having happened. But on this particular day, something was different.
 She woke up feeling unusually motivated and decided to take a walk into the forest that she had never dared to go into before.

As she walked deeper and deeper into the woods, she began to feel as though she was being watched. She turned around but saw nothing but trees. Suddenly, she heard a rustling in the bushes behind her. She froze in fear, not knowing what to do. But then, out of the bushes leapt a beautiful deer. The girl felt relieved and happy, and continued on her way through the forest with a new sense of wonderment.
