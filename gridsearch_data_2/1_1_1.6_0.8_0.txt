The life of a small-town girl only ever seemed to be one of boredom and simplicity. She would wake up each day, do the same things she always did, and go to bed with nothing new having happened. But on this particular day, something was different.
 She woke up earlier than usual and decided to take a walk into the forest that surrounded her town. Once she was deep enough in that she couldn't see her town anymore, she sat down on a log and let out a deep breath. It felt good to be in nature, something she hadn't done in quite some time.

Suddenly, she heard a noise off in the distance. It sounded like someone was crying. She got up from the log and followed the sound until she came to a clearing where a woman was kneeling on the ground, sobbing uncontrollably. The small-town girl didn't know what to do but offer her help. She knelt down next to the woman and asked what was wrong.
It turned out that the woman had lost her husband recently and didn't know how to go on without him. The small-town girl listened as the woman poured her heart out; told her everything about him and how they met, their life together, and how much he meant to her now that he was gone. As she talked, it became clear just how much this woman loved him and how difficult it must be for her to go on without him by her side each day. 

The small-town girl stayed with the woman until nightfall when she finally stopped crying and seemed calmer overall. Then she helped the woman back to town where they went their separate ways -the small-town girl feeling grateful for having experienced something new today, even if it wasn't necessarily happy..
