The life of a small-town girl only ever seemed to be one of boredom and simplicity. She would wake up each day, do the same things she always did, and go to bed with nothing new having happened. But on this particular day, something was different.
 She woke up feeling uneasy, as if something big was about to happen. She tried to shake the feeling and go about her day as normal, but by lunchtime she knew that something was definitely different.

As she sat in her usual spot in the cafe, she noticed a stranger walking in. He was a tall man with dark hair and an aura around him that screamed danger. She couldn't take her eyes off him as he made his way to the counter. He ordered a coffee and then turned to look at her. Their eyes met and she felt a sudden jolt of electricity course through her body. She didn't know what it was, but she knew that this man was going to change her life forever.
