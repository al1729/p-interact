The life of a small-town girl only ever seemed to be one of boredom and simplicity. She would wake up each day, do the same things she always did, and go to bed with nothing new having happened. But on this particular day, something was different.
 As she left her house to go about her day, she noticed a strange light in the sky. At first, she thought nothing of it and went on with her day. But as the day went on, the light grew brighter and closer until it was right above her. She looked up and saw a spacecraft landing in front of her. Out from the spaceship came an extraterrestrial being who approached her. The small-town girl was suddenly faced with the most exciting event that had ever happened to her. Though she could not understand what the being was saying, she knew that this was going to change her life forever.
