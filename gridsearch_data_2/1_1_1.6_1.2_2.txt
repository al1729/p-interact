The life of a small-town girl only ever seemed to be one of boredom and simplicity. She would wake up each day, do the same things she always did, and go to bed with nothing new having happened. But on this particular day, something was different.
 She woke up with a feeling of anticipation, as if something exciting was going to happen. And sure enough, it did.

She went about her day as usual at first, but then she began to notice little things that were out of the ordinary. The colors seem brighter, the air smelled sweeter, and everyone she passed seemed to be smiling just a little bit wider than usual. It was as if the world was new again - and she loved it!

By the time she went to bed that night, she knew that this had been one of the best days of her life. She didn't know what had caused it, but she hoped that whatever it was would stay around for a long time to come.
