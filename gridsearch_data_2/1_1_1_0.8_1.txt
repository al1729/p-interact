As she went about her day, she noticed that everyone seemed to be in a good mood. Even the grumpy old man at the grocery store was cracks a smile. She began to feel like something wonderful was going to happen.

As she walked home from the grocery store, she saw a large crowd gathered in the town square. She walked over to see what was going on and saw that someone had won the lottery! She couldn't believe it! It was finally her turn for something exciting to happen in her life!
