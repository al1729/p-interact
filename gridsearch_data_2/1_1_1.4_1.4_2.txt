The life of a small-town girl only ever seemed to be one of boredom and simplicity. She would wake up each day, do the same things she always did, and go to bed with nothing new having happened. But on this particular day, something was different.
 She woke up feeling as though something important was going to happen. And sure enough, by the time she went to bed that night, her whole life had changed.

The girl had always been a bit of an outsider in her small town. She was never quite sure why, but she always felt like she didn't quite fit in. So when she got the chance to leave and see the world, she jumped at it. She packed her bags and said goodbye to her small-town life, never looking back.

Now, years later, she was standing on stage accepting an award for her work as a writer. It was something she'd always wanted to do, but never thought possible. As she accepted the award and looked out at the cheering crowd, she knew that anything is possible if you dare to dream big.
