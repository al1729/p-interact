The life of a small-town girl only ever seemed to be one of boredom and simplicity. She would wake up each day, do the same things she always did, and go to bed with nothing new having happened. But on this particular day, something was different.


As she left her house to go about her day, she noticed a feather lying on the ground. It was beautiful and unlike anything she had ever seen before. She picked it up and decided to keep it with her.

As the day went on, more and more feathers appeared. Everywhere she looked, there were feathers of all colors and sizes. Soon enough, the whole town was covered in them.

The girl began to feel as if something magical was happening. And indeed it was; for that night, when everyone else in town was asleep, the girl saw hundreds of fairies flitting around their homes adding finishing touches to their handiwork - covering the small-town in a blanket of beauty overnight.
