The life of a small-town girl only ever seemed to be one of boredom and simplicity. She would wake up each day, do the same things she always did, and go to bed with nothing new having happened. But on this particular day, something was different.
 She woke up feeling as though something exciting was going to happen. And sure enough, by the time she went to bed that night, her life had changed forever.

The girl had always been a bit of a dreamer, and she often daydreamed about what it would be like to have an adventure. So when she woke up feeling like something special was going to happen, she couldn't help but feel excited. She spent the day going about her usual routine, but all the while she couldn't shake the feeling that something was about to happen.

As evening began to fall, the girl started to feel nervous. What if her adventure didn't live up to her expectations? What if it was dangerous? But before she could talk herself out of it,she heard a knock at her door. She opened it to find a handsome stranger standing before her. He told her that he'd been watching her and he could see that she was bored with her life. He said he had something for her - an opportunity for adventure.

The girl's heart raced as she realized this was exactly what she'd been waiting for. Without hesitation, she accepted his offer and followed him into the night..
