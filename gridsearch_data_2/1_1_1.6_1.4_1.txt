The life of a small-town girl only ever seemed to be one of boredom and simplicity. She would wake up each day, do the same things she always did, and go to bed with nothing new having happened. But on this particular day, something was different.
 She woke up earlier than usual and decided to take a walk around her neighborhood. As she walked, she noticed that everything seemed...off. The color of the sky was wrong, the sun was too low in the sky, and even the air felt different. But despite all these oddities, she kept walking until she got to the edge of her town. And there, she saw something that made her heart stop - monsters were attacking her town!

She ran as fast as she could back home, warning everyone about what was happening. They quickly fortified their homes and prepared for battle. The girl knew that it would be up to her to save her town from these creatures. She grabbed a weapon and ran towards them, ready to fight for her home.
