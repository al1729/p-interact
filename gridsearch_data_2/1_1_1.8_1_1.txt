The life of a small-town girl only ever seemed to be one of boredom and simplicity. She would wake up each day, do the same things she always did, and go to bed with nothing new having happened. But on this particular day, something was different.
 The girl woke up to find that she had been transformed into a beautiful butterfly. At first, she was thrilled by her new found beauty and freedom. She flitted from flower to flower, reveling in the sensation of the wind on her delicate wings. But as the day wore on, she began to feel more and more trapped. Sure, she could still fly but it didn't seem like enough anymore. She missed the warmth of human contact and longed for something more substantial than nectar to sustain her. By nightfall, she had made up her mind; she would find a way back to being a normal girl again even if it meant giving up her beautiful wings forever
