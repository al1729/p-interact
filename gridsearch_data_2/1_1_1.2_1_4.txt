The life of a small-town girl only ever seemed to be one of boredom and simplicity. She would wake up each day, do the same things she always did, and go to bed with nothing new having happened. But on this particular day, something was different.
 She woke up feeling as if something exciting was going to happen. And sure enough, by the time she went to bed that night, her life had been changed forever.

The day started out like any other, but the small-town girl soon realized that there was something different in the air. She couldn't quite put her finger on it, but she knew that something was about to happen. She went about her day as usual, but she couldn't help but feel a sense of anticipation. By the time evening came, she was sure that something was going to happen.

And then it did. Late in the night, there was a knock at her door. When she answered it, she found herself face-to-face with a stranger. He was tall and handsome, and he told her that he had come from far away just to see her. The small-town girl could hardly believe it as he spoke; never before had anything so exciting happened to her! They talked for hours into the night until finally, exhausted, they fell asleep in each others' arms.

When she woke up the next morning, the small-town girl knew that her life would never be the same again. She had found love in a most unlikely place - and it was all because something different had happened on this one ordinary day.
