The life of a small-town girl only ever seemed to be one of boredom and simplicity. She would wake up each day, do the same things she always did, and go to bed with nothing new having happened. But on this particular day, something was different.
 She woke up to the sound of something she had never heard before - laughter. Laughter coming from outside her window. It was the most beautiful sound she had ever heard, and it filled her with an inexplicable joy. She quickly got out of bed and ran to the window, throwing it open to see who was responsible for this joyful noise. But when she looked out, there was nobody there. Just an empty field with the wind blowing through the grass. She stood there for a moment, wondering if she had imagined it. But no, she could still hear the laughter; it was just as clear as before. And now that she listened more carefully, she could also hear other voices - voices singing, talking, crying; all sorts of emotions conveyed through sound alone. She was entranced by this symphony of noise and felt herself being drawn towards it.

She stepped out of her house and began walking towards the source of the noise, drawn in like a moth to a flame. The further she walked, the louder and clearer the noises became until they were almost overwhelming her senses. But still she kept going until she came to a clearing in the woods where somebody - or something - was sat in the middle playing a strange instrument that looked like two pieces of wood attached together at one end. As soon as they saw her, they stopped playing and jumped up excitedly, running over to greet her enthusiastically.

The next thing she knew,she was surrounded by these creatures - whatever they were - laughing and chatting away merrily as if they had known each other forever. They didn't seem to notice anything strange about her appearance or question why she was there amongst them; they just accepted her unconditionally which made her feel even more at ease than before .It wasn't long before she found herself joining in with their fun too; forgetting all about her boring life back home as if it belonged to someone else entirely
