The life of a small-town girl only ever seemed to be one of boredom and simplicity. She would wake up each day, do the same things she always did, and go to bed with nothing new having happened. But on this particular day, something was different.
 She could feel it in the air.

As she went about her day, she couldn’t help but notice the sense of anticipation that seemed to be building all around her. By the time evening came, she was sure that something big was about to happen. She just didn’t know what it was.

As she lay in bed that night, she heard a noise outside her window. She got up to investigate and saw a shooting star streaking across the sky. She wished on it with all her heart, and then went back to bed feeling excited for what the future might hold.
