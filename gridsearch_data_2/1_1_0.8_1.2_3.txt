The life of a small-town girl only ever seemed to be one of boredom and simplicity. She would wake up each day, do the same things she always did, and go to bed with nothing new having happened. But on this particular day, something was different.


As she went about her usual routine, she couldn't help but feel as though something was watching her. It was a feeling she couldn't shake, no matter how hard she tried. And then, when she was least expecting it, something happened that would change her life forever.

She was out walking in the woods behind her house when she heard a noise in the distance. At first, she thought it was just an animal or the wind, but as it got closer, she realized that it sounded like someone crying.

She followed the noise until she came to a clearing and there, in the middle of it, was a boy around her age crying hysterically. He looked up at her with such desperation in his eyes that she didn't know what to do except comfort him.

And from that moment on, she knew that her life would never be boring or simple again.
