The life of a small-town girl only ever seemed to be one of boredom and simplicity. She would wake up each day, do the same things she always did, and go to bed with nothing new having happened. But on this particular day, something was different.
 She woke up feeling excited for what the day might bring.

As she went about her usual routine, she couldn't help but feel that something special was going to happen. And sure enough, by the time afternoon rolled around, her suspicions were confirmed. A letter had arrived, addressed to her. She eagerly tore it open, and read the words that would change her life forever: she had been accepted into a prestigious writing program.

The small-town girl suddenly found herself with a new sense of purpose. She knew that this was her chance to finally make something of herself and pursue her dreams. With hard work and determination, she was going to make it big.
