The life of a small-town girl only ever seemed to be one of boredom and simplicity. She would wake up each day, do the same things she always did, and go to bed with nothing new having happened. But on this particular day, something was different.
 She woke up feeling excited for the first time in a long time. She couldn't explain it, but she just had a good feeling about today.

As she went through her daily routine, she started to notice little things that were different. The sky was a little bit bluer, the sun was shining a little bit brighter. It was as if the world was new again. And when she went to bed that night, she fell asleep with a smile on her face, knowing that tomorrow would be even better than today.
