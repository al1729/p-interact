The life of a small-town girl only ever seemed to be one of boredom and simplicity. She would wake up each day, do the same things she always did, and go to bed with nothing new having happened. But on this particular day, something was different.
 She woke up feeling as though something important was going to happen. And sure enough, by the time she went to bed that night, her whole life had changed.

The girl could hardly believe it when she saw the report on the news. A small airplane had crash-landed in a field near her town and there were no survivors. She knew that this was what she had been waiting for - an adventure. With no one left to hold her back, she packed her bags and set off for the site of the crash.

It didn't take long for her to find it. The wreckage was still smoldering and there were bodies everywhere. It was a gruesome sight, but the girl didn't falter. She began searching through the debris, looking for anything that might be of use to her on her quest. And then she found it - a map with a big X mark over what looked like an island in the middle of nowhere."
