The life of a small-town girl only ever seemed to be one of boredom and simplicity. She would wake up each day, do the same things she always did, and go to bed with nothing new having happened. But on this particular day, something was different.
 She woke up feeling unusually excited, as if something great was about to happen. And sure enough, by the time she went to bed that night, her life had changed forever.

It started with a phone call from her best friend. They hadn't talked in months, but for some reason she felt compelled to answer it. Her friend told her about a new club that was opening up in the city and convinced her to come down for the grand opening weekend. She hesitated at first, but eventually agreed.

And so it was that she found herself on a bus headed towards the city with excitement coursing through her veins. She had never been out of her small town before and this felt like an adventure. When she arrived at the club, she instantly loved it. The music was loud and thrilling and there were people everywhere dancing and having fun. She let herself get swept up in the atmosphere and ended up staying until closing time.
