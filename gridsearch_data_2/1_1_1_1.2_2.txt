The life of a small-town girl only ever seemed to be one of boredom and simplicity. She would wake up each day, do the same things she always did, and go to bed with nothing new having happened. But on this particular day, something was different.
 Instead of the same-old, same-old, she found herself in the middle of a busy city. She was confused and disoriented, unsure of how she got there or what she was supposed to do.

As she looked around, she saw that everyone was going about their day as if nothing out of the ordinary was happening. But to her, everything was new and strange. She didn't know where she belonged in this big city.

But then she spotted a familiar face walking towards her. It was someone from her small town who had moved to the city years ago. They Stoped And Look At Each Otherhappy to see each other again despite the circumstances. The girl felt relief wash over her as she realized that she wasn't alone in this unfamiliar place after all.
