The life of a small-town girl only ever seemed to be one of boredom and simplicity. She would wake up each day, do the same things she always did, and go to bed with nothing new having happened. But on this particular day, something was different.


As she walked to school, she noticed a strange man standing on the corner. He was wearing a long black coat and had a mysterious air about him. She had never seen him before, but somehow she felt like she could trust him.

She walked up to him and said hello. They began talking and it quickly became clear that he was not from around here. He told her he was looking for someone - someone who seemed to be in trouble. The girl asked if she could help, but the man said no, this was something he had to do alone.

But as they continued talking, the girl got an idea of where this person might be hiding out. She told the man her idea and offered to take him there herself. After a moment's hesitation, he agreed.

The two of them set off together and eventually came to an old abandoned house on the edge of town which matched the description perfectly. There were lights on inside and it looked like somebody was home after all these years...
