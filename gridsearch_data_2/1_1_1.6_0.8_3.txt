The life of a small-town girl only ever seemed to be one of boredom and simplicity. She would wake up each day, do the same things she always did, and go to bed with nothing new having happened. But on this particular day, something was different.
 She woke up feeling excitement for the day ahead. She had no idea what was going to happen, but she knew that it would be something special.

As she went about her day, she couldn't help but notice that everyone seemed to be in a good mood. Even the usually grumpy old man at the grocery store was smiling and wishing her a nice day. It was almost as if they all knew something that she didn't.

Later on, when she was walking home from school, she saw a group of kids gathered around something in the street. As she got closer, she realized that they were looking at a flyer for a carnival that was coming to town in just two days! She couldn't believe it - this small town never got any big events like this! She immediately forgot about everything else and ran home to tell her parents the news.

The next two days flew by in a blur of anticipation and excitement. Finally, it was opening night of the carnival! The girl could hardly contain herself as she walked through the gates and entered into a world of fun and adventure. There were so many things to see and do;she didn't know where to begin! After trying out some rides and playing some games,she decided to get cotton candy for herselfand ice cream for her parents .Oneparticular game caught her eye - it looked difficult ,but also really fun .She put downa coupleof ticketsand nervously picked up one oar... before realizingthatitwas actuallya 2 person game ! Oh well ,maybe someonewill joinme lateron ...
