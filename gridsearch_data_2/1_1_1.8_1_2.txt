The life of a small-town girl only ever seemed to be one of boredom and simplicity. She would wake up each day, do the same things she always did, and go to bed with nothing new having happened. But on this particular day, something was different.
 The girl woke up to find that she was no longer in her small town, but in a bustling city. She walked the streets in amazement, taking in all the sights and sounds of this new place.

She didn't know how she had gotten here or what had happened to her old life, but she was determined to make the most of it. The girl explored the city for hours, finding new things to see and do at every turn. As night began to fall, she found herself atop a tall building overlooking the cityscape. It was then that she realized: this was where she belonged. This was her new home.
