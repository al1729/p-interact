The life of a small-town girl only ever seemed to be one of boredom and simplicity. She would wake up each day, do the same things she always did, and go to bed with nothing new having happened. But on this particular day, something was different.
 She woke up feeling as though something exciting was going to happen.

As she went about her day, she couldn't help but notice that everyone around her seemed to be in a good mood too. Even the grumpy old lady at the grocery store was smiling. It was like something had happened overnight that had put everyone in a good mood.



The girl wondered what could have caused such a change and decided to ask someone. She approached a group of kids who were laughing and joking together and asked them what was going on. They told her that they had heard that there was going to be a carnival in town! The girl's eyes lit up with excitement - she hadn't been to a carnival in years! 

She thanked the kids and ran off home to tell her parents the news. Sure enough, when she arrived home they were already packing their bags for the carnival. It seemed like this small-town girl's life was about to get just a little bit more exciting after all!
