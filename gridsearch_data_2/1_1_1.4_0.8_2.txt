The life of a small-town girl only ever seemed to be one of boredom and simplicity. She would wake up each day, do the same things she always did, and go to bed with nothing new having happened. But on this particular day, something was different.
 She woke up feeling dizzy and off-balance, as if the world was spinning around her. When she tried to get out of bed, she found that her legs would not support her. She collapsed onto the floor, screaming for help.

The girl's mother rushed into the room, panic etched onto her face. She scooped her daughter up in her arms and carried her to the car, speeding towards the hospital with only one thought on her mind: please let my baby be alright.

At the hospital, doctors and nurses swarmed around the girl, asking questions and running tests. After what felt like forever, a doctor finally came to speak with the girl's mother. He told her that his daughter had an incurable disease called Friedreich's ataxia which would gradually rob her of her ability to walk, talk, and eventually breathe. There was no cure or treatment; all they could do was make sure she was comfortable in whatever time she had left.

The news hit like a ton of bricks; everything suddenly became clear to the girl. All those times she had complained about being bored or wanting something more out of life...she now realized how lucky she was just to have been alive up until this point. No longer able to take anything for granted, she spent each day cherishing every moment with those she loved most while appreciating all that life had given her - even if it wasn't much by some standards.

And so despite everything going against her from a physical standpoint, this small-town girl continued living life as best as she could until finally succumbing to Friedreich's ataxia several years later surrounded by those who loved her dearly."
