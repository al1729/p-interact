The life of a small-town girl only ever seemed to be one of boredom and simplicity. She would wake up each day, do the same things she always did, and go to bed with nothing new having happened. But on this particular day, something was different.
 She woke up feeling strange, as if something was waiting for her.

She couldn't shake the feeling all day, and by the time night fell, she was sure that whatever it was would come for her. She lay in bed wide awake, afraid to close her eyes in case she missed what was coming for her. Suddenly, there was a noise at her window. Slowly and tentatively, she got out of bed and approached it.

Looking out, she saw a large bird perched on the sill. It looked at her with its bright blue eyes and seemed to be trying to tell her something. She didn't know what it meant but felt drawn to follow it when it flew away into the night. Without thinking any further, she climbed out of the window and followed after it."
