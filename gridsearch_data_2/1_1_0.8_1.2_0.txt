The life of a small-town girl only ever seemed to be one of boredom and simplicity. She would wake up each day, do the same things she always did, and go to bed with nothing new having happened. But on this particular day, something was different.
 She woke up feeling as if something exciting were about to happen. She couldn't explain it, but she had a sense that today was going to be special.

As she went about her day, she noticed more and more things that seemed out of the ordinary. The sun was shining brighter than usual, the birds were singing louder, and even the breeze seemed warmer. She began to feel like she was in a dream.

As the day went on, her sense of excitement only grew stronger. By the time night fell, she was sure that something wonderful was going to happen. And then, just as she was about to drift off to sleep, it did. She heard a noise outside her window and ran to see what it was. There in her backyard was a beautiful shooting star! She making a wish on it before it disappeared into the night sky. It felt like anything was possible now and she couldn't wait to see what tomorrow would bring
