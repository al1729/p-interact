The life of a small-town girl only ever seemed to be one of boredom and simplicity. She would wake up each day, do the same things she always did, and go to bed with nothing new having happened. But on this particular day, something was different.
 She could feel it in the air.

As she went about her day, she noticed that everyone seemed to be looking at her differently. They were all smiling and whispering to each other, as if they knew something she didn't. It was almost like they were keeping a secret from her.

She couldn't take it anymore; she had to know what was going on. So, she asked the first person she saw what was happening. And that's when she learned that today was the day thatshe had won the lottery!
