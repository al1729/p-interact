The life of a small-town girl only ever seemed to be one of boredom and simplicity. She would wake up each day, do the same things she always did, and go to bed with nothing new having happened. But on this particular day, something was different.
 She woke up feeling happy for no reason at all, and she just couldn't help but smile.

As she went about her day, she noticed that everyone around her seemed to be in a good mood as well. Even the usually grouchy old man who lived next door was whistling a tune as he watered his plants. It was like the whole world was filled with happiness, and it was all because of her.

She wondered if maybe this was what it felt like to be truly alive - to have each day be something new and exciting. If so, she could definitely get used to it!
