The life of a small-town girl only ever seemed to be one of boredom and simplicity. She would wake up each day, do the same things she always did, and go to bed with nothing new having happened. But on this particular day, something was different.


As she left her house to go about her day, she noticed a trail of glowing blue butterflies leading off into the distance. Without even thinking, she followed them. They led her deep into the forest, farther than she had ever been before. And there, in a clearing surrounded by flowers and butterflies, was a magnificent castle made entirely of glass.

She walked up to it slowly, awestruck by its beauty. It looked like something out of a fairy tale. And then she saw him – the most beautiful man she had ever laid eyes on. He was standing in front of the door to the castle, as if waiting for someone. When their eyes met, time seemed to stop completely.

It was love at first sight for both of them – they knew it instantly and nothing could tear them apart from that moment onward. They spent that day exploring every inch of the castle and talking non-stop; they never wanted to leave each other’s side again . . .
