The life of a small-town girl only ever seemed to be one of boredom and simplicity. She would wake up each day, do the same things she always did, and go to bed with nothing new having happened. But on this particular day, something was different.
 She woke up feeling strange, as if something big was going to happen. And sure enough, by the end of the day, her whole life had changed.

The girl went about her normal routine at first, but she couldn't help but feel that something was off. She tried to shake it off, but the feeling only got stronger as the day went on. By lunchtime, she was certain that something significant was going to happen; she just didn't know what it would be.

As she finished up her last class for the day and made her way home, she still felt a sense of anticipation building inside of her. When she walked through the door of her house and saw her mother sitting at the kitchen table with a serious expression on her face, she knew that whatever was about to happen would be life-changing.
