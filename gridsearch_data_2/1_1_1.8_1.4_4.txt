The life of a small-town girl only ever seemed to be one of boredom and simplicity. She would wake up each day, do the same things she always did, and go to bed with nothing new having happened. But on this particular day, something was different.
 She woke up feeling as though something exciting was about to happen. And sure enough, by the time lunch came around, she had received a letter telling her that she had won a prestigious award. She was overjoyed and couldn't wait to tell her friends and family. When she finally returned home that night, she sat down at her computer and typed out a short story about the events of the day - an award-winning short story that would go on to be read by people all over the world.
