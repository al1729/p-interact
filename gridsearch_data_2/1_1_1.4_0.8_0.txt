The life of a small-town girl only ever seemed to be one of boredom and simplicity. She would wake up each day, do the same things she always did, and go to bed with nothing new having happened. But on this particular day, something was different.
 She woke up feeling excited for no reason at all, and she couldn't help but smile. It seemed like today was going to be a good day.

As she went about her normal routine, she noticed that everyone around her seemed to be in a good mood as well. Even the cashier at the grocery store was humming a happy tune as she rung up her purchase. It was almost as if something wonderful was about to happen.

And then, it did. As she walked out of the grocery store, she saw a large beautiful butterfly land on her shoulder. She gasped in delight and reached up to stroke its delicate wings. It seemed like this was indeed shaping up to be the best day ever!
