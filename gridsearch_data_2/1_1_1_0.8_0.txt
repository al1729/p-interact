The life of a small-town girl only ever seemed to be one of boredom and simplicity. She would wake up each day, do the same things she always did, and go to bed with nothing new having happened. But on this particular day, something was different.
 She could feel it in the air.

As she left her house to go about her day, she noticed that the birds were singing louder than usual and the sun was shining brighter. She had a skip in her step as she went about her errands, feeling like something wonderful was about to happen. And then, suddenly, it did.

She ran into him. The boy she had been secretly in love with for years. They bumped into each other and they both felt an instantaneous spark. They knew this was meant to be. From that moment on, their lives were changed forever.
