The life of a small-town girl only ever seemed to be one of boredom and simplicity. She would wake up each day, do the same things she always did, and go to bed with nothing new having happened. But on this particular day, something was different.


As she walked to school, she noticed a strange man walking behind her. He was wearing all black and had a hood pulled up over his head, so she couldn't see his face. She tried to ignore him, but he kept pace with her, matching her every step.

She quickened her pace, but so did he. By the time she got to school, she was running. She looked back just long enough to see the man still following her before she burst through the doors of the school and ran to find her friends.

They were huddled together in a group, talking in hushed tones. When they saw her coming, they stopped talking and stared at her wide-eyed. "What's wrong?" one of them asked breathlessly.

"There's a man," she gasped out between breaths."He's following me!"
