The life of a small-town girl only ever seemed to be one of boredom and simplicity. She would wake up each day, do the same things she always did, and go to bed with nothing new having happened. But on this particular day, something was different.
 She woke up feeling excited for the first time in a long while. She had no idea what was going to happen, but she knew that it was going to be something special.

As she went about her day, she tried to guess what could be causing this sudden change in her mood. Was it because today was her birthday? No, that couldn't be it - she didn't even like birthdays. Or maybe someone had finally asked her out on a date? But no, that wasn't it either. She had been single for as long as she could remember and didn't really see that changing anytime soon.

So what was it then? Whatever the reason, she was determined to find out. And then, just as suddenly as the feeling had come over her, she realized what it was: today was the day she would finally escape from this small town and never look back.
