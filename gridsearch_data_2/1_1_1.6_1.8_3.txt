The life of a small-town girl only ever seemed to be one of boredom and simplicity. She would wake up each day, do the same things she always did, and go to bed with nothing new having happened. But on this particular day, something was different.
 She woke up feeling excited, as if something great was about to happen. And sure enough, by the time she went to bed that night, her life had changed forever.

She could hardly believe it when she saw the application in her mailbox. She had always dreamed of going to college, but never thought it would be possible. But there it was, an acceptance letter from the school of her dreams. She knew it was meant to be.

The girl packed her bags and said goodbye to her small town life for good. She was off on a new adventure, one that would take her places she never even dared dream of before. Who knows what lies ahead?
