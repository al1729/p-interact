The life of a small-town girl only ever seemed to be one of boredom and simplicity. She would wake up each day, do the same things she always did, and go to bed with nothing new having happened. But on this particular day, something was different.
 Instead of waking up to the sound of birds chirping outside her window, she was jolted awake by a loud crash. When she got out of bed to investigate, she found that her small town had been overrun by giant monsters! Everywhere she looked, there were towering creatures destroying everything in sight. Buildings were being toppled, cars were being smashed, and people were screaming in terror.

The girl tried to run away, but one of the monsters grabbed her with its huge hand. She thought for sure she was going to die. But then, the creature started to shrink until it was the same size as her! It turns out that the monsters were just regular animals that had been affected by a strange phenomenon. The girl laughed at her own scare and went back to bed, wondering what other adventures lie ahead in her small town.
