The life of a small-town girl only ever seemed to be one of boredom and simplicity. She would wake up each day, do the same things she always did, and go to bed with nothing new having happened. But on this particular day, something was different.
 It was as if the world around her was moving in a slow-motion blur and she couldn't focus on anything.

In the middle of homework, she heard a knock on the door.Slowly, she got up to answer it, her heart pounding in her chest for some unknown reason. When she opened the door, there was no one there. But then she saw it: a shining gold envelope laying innocently on the welcome mat. She felt like she couldn't breathe as she reached down to pick it up; trembling slightly, she ripped open the seal and pulled out the card inside. In neat cursive handwriting, it said "You have been chosen." There was nothing else. No explanation, no instructions; just those four words that somehow changed everything.

The girl knew what this meant;she had been waitingfor something like thisher whole life without even realizing it. She quickly changed into her best clothes and grabbed her mother's old suitcase from the attic before heading out into an uncertain future with nothing but excitement in her heart.
