The life of a small-town girl only ever seemed to be one of boredom and simplicity. She would wake up each day, do the same things she always did, and go to bed with nothing new having happened. But on this particular day, something was different.
 She could feel it in the air.

As she went about her daily routine, she couldn’t help but notice the feeling of anticipation that was building up inside of her. She didn’t know what it was, but something was definitely going to happen.

And sure enough, as the day went on, more and more strange things began to occur. First, a flock of birds flew overhead, followed by a parade of ants marching through the town square. Then, a group of children ran by laughing and shouting, their parents running behind them trying to catch up.

As night began to fall, the girl walked home with a sense of excitement buzzing through her. She knew whatever was happening was about to reach its culmination.

And she wasn’t wrong. As she rounded the corner to her house, she saw a pink balloon floating in front of her door. With shaking hands, she reached out and grabbed it, feeling like this was finally the thing that had been waiting for her all day long.
