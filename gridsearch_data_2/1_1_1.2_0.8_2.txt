The life of a small-town girl only ever seemed to be one of boredom and simplicity. She would wake up each day, do the same things she always did, and go to bed with nothing new having happened. But on this particular day, something was different.
 She woke up feeling excited, as if something great was about to happen. She couldn't explain it, but she just knew that today was the day that her life would change forever.

As she went about her usual routines, she felt a sense of anticipation building inside of her. It was like everything was leading up to something big. And sure enough, by the end of the day, she had made a decision that would alter the course of her life forever: she was going to move to the city and pursue her dream of becoming a writer.

It wasn't an easy decision, but it was one that she knew deep down was right for her. And so, with a new sense of purpose and determination, she packed up her belongings and set off for the bright lights of the big city.

She had always known that there was more out there for her than this small town could offer; and now, finally, she was going to go out and find it.
