The life of a small-town girl only ever seemed to be one of boredom and simplicity. She would wake up each day, do the same things she always did, and go to bed with nothing new having happened. But on this particular day, something was different.


As she went about her usual routine, the girl couldn't help but feel as though something was watching her. It was a feeling she had never experienced before, and it made her skin crawl. She tried to shake it off, but the sensation only grew stronger until she felt like she was being suffocated by an invisible force.

Looking around her small town, the girl saw that everything appeared to be normal. But despite this reassurance, she couldn't shake the feeling that something bad was about to happen.

Suddenly, without warning, the ground began to shake and crack open. Buildings started to collapse and people started screaming. The small-town girl was terrified and didn't know what to do.

Then, just as suddenly as it had begun, it stopped. The girl looked around in confusion at the destruction that surrounded her. What had once been a peaceful town was now a scene of devastation. And in the middle of it all stood the girl, completely unharmed.
