The life of a small-town girl only ever seemed to be one of boredom and simplicity. She would wake up each day, do the same things she always did, and go to bed with nothing new having happened. But on this particular day, something was different.
 She woke up earlier than usual and began to get ready for the day when she realized that she couldn't remember what her plans were. She thought for a moment before shrugging it off and deciding to just go outside and see what happened.

As soon as she stepped out of her house, she was greeted by a scene of complete chaos. Houses were being demolished, cars were crashing into each other, and people were running around screaming. She didn't know what was going on, but she knew that something was definitely wrong. She started to run in the opposite direction of all the commotion when she saw someone coming towards her. He looked disheveled and exhausted, like he had been through a lot. 

"What's going on?" she yelled at him as he ran past her.

"The world is ending!" he shouted back before disappearing into the crowd
