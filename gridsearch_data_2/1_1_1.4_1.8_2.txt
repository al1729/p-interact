The life of a small-town girl only ever seemed to be one of boredom and simplicity. She would wake up each day, do the same things she always did, and go to bed with nothing new having happened. But on this particular day, something was different.
 Instead of the sun shining through her window, she woke up to darkness. It was as if night had fallen in the middle of the day.

She got out of bed and went to look outside, but there was nothing there. No houses, no streets, no people. Just an infinite stretch of blackness. She couldn't even see the stars. The only light came from a small red glow on the horizon that seemed to be getting closer.

As it grew nearer, she could make out a figure within the light. It was a man, with burning eyes and skin made of coal. He carried a staff with a glowing orb at its tip, and he seemed to be floating above the ground.

He stopped in front of her house and looked down at her with his soulless eyes. In a voice that sounded like rocks grinding together, he spoke three words: "Your time has come."
