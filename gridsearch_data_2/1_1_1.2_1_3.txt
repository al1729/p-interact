The life of a small-town girl only ever seemed to be one of boredom and simplicity. She would wake up each day, do the same things she always did, and go to bed with nothing new having happened. But on this particular day, something was different.
 She woke up to the sound of birds chirping outside her window and the sun shining in through the cracks in her curtains. She leapt out of bed, excited for what the day might bring.

As she left her house, she saw that everything was different. The trees were taller, the sky was bluer, and the flowers were brighter. She skipped down the street with a spring in her step, feeling happier than she ever had before.

Everywhere she went, people smiled at her and said hello. Even the animals seemed friendlier than usual. She felt like she was walking on air as she made her way to school, eagerly anticipating what would happen next.

At school, all her friends gathered around her, asking where she’d been and what was wrong with her. They hadn’t seen her since yesterday afternoon when she ran off after having a huge argument with her mom about going to college out of state. But now she didn’t even remember why she’d been upset; everything seemed so perfect that it couldn’t possibly matter anymore.
