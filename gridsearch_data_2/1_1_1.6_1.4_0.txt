The life of a small-town girl only ever seemed to be one of boredom and simplicity. She would wake up each day, do the same things she always did, and go to bed with nothing new having happened. But on this particular day, something was different.


As she went about her daily routine, she couldn’t help but notice that there was something strange in the air. It was as if something big was about to happen, though she couldn’t quite put her finger on what it might be.

She went about her day as usual, but with a feeling of anticipation building inside of her. And then, as the sun began to set, she heard it: a loud booming noise that seemed to come from nowhere and everywhere at once.

She ran outside to see what had caused the noise and saw the most incredible sight: a giant meteorite had just crashed into the nearby forest! She stood there in awe for a moment before remembered her camera and ran back inside to get it.
