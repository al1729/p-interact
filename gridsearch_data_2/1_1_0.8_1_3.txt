The life of a small-town girl only ever seemed to be one of boredom and simplicity. She would wake up each day, do the same things she always did, and go to bed with nothing new having happened. But on this particular day, something was different.
 She woke up to find that everything in her town had changed. The streets were empty, the houses were abandoned, and not a single living soul could be found. She was completely alone.

With no one else around, she began to explore her town and soon realized that she wasn't the only one who had been left behind. There were other people there, hiding in the shadows and scared of what might happen to them. Together, they slowly began to build a new life for themselves, creating their own society with their own rules. And although it wasn't the life she had always dreamed of, it was still a life worth living.
