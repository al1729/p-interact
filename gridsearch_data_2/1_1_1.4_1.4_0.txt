The life of a small-town girl only ever seemed to be one of boredom and simplicity. She would wake up each day, do the same things she always did, and go to bed with nothing new having happened. But on this particular day, something was different.


As she went about her usual routine, she felt a sense of anticipation building inside of her. She couldn't explain it, but something was definitely going to happen today. And sure enough, by the time evening rolled around, she had been proven right.

She was sitting in her bedroom, reading a book as usual, when she heard a knock at the door downstairs. Peeking out her window to see who it could be, she didn't recognize the car parked in front of her house. But that didn't matter- whoever it was, they were here for her.

She hastily put on a coat and ran down the stairs to answer the door. And there he was- standing tall and handsome with a big smile on his face, holding a bouquet of flowers behind his back. It was him-the boy from high school who she had always secretly loved but never dared to speak to.

And finally, after all these years, he had come back for her.
