The life of a small-town girl only ever seemed to be one of boredom and simplicity. She would wake up each day, do the same things she always did, and go to bed with nothing new having happened. But on this particular day, something was different.
 She woke up feeling as though something exciting was going to happen. And sure enough, by the time she went to bed that night, her life had changed completely.

The girl had always been a good student, but today she felt like she could conquer the world. She eagerly went through her classes, Participating in every discussion and making sure her voice was heard. The other students looked at her differently, as if they were seeing her for the first time. 

At lunchtime, she usually sat with her friend Sarah and gossiped about boys or who wore the coolest clothes to school. But today Sarah wasn't there--she was sitting with another group of girls across the cafeteria--so the small-town girl decided to sit by herself. She didn't mind; it felt empowering to be alone in a room full of people. 
The rest of the day flew by and before she knew it, it was time for after-school activities. She normally avoided extracurriculars like the plague, but today she was feeling adventurous so she signed up for everything: club meetings, sports tryouts...you name it! It felt exhilarating to put herself out there and try new things; things that were outside of her comfort zone..for once in her life, she wasn't boring old small-town girl--she was somebody new entirely
