The life of a small-town girl only ever seemed to be one of boredom and simplicity. She would wake up each day, do the same things she always did, and go to bed with nothing new having happened. But on this particular day, something was different.
 She woke up feeling like something amazing was about to happen. And sure enough, by the time the day was over, her life had been changed forever.

She had always loved going on walks around her neighborhood, but today, she felt called to wander further than she ever had before. She ended up at the edge of a forest that she had never seen before. It looked dark and foreboding, but she couldn't help but feel drawn to it. Trusting her intuition, she stepped into the woods.

As she made her way deeper and deeper into the forest, she began to feel as though she was being watched. But instead of feeling scared, she only felt more excited. She knew that something magical was happening. And then, suddenly, she came upon a small clearing in the woods. And in the center of that clearing was a beautiful Fairy waiting for her.

The Fairy told her that she had been chosen to be their Queen's new handmaiden and that she would have to leave her old life behind. Of course, the girl didn't hesitate; she agreed immediately! And just like that, her boring old life was turned into an adventure beyond anything she could have ever imagined.
