The life of a small-town girl only ever seemed to be one of boredom and simplicity. She would wake up each day, do the same things she always did, and go to bed with nothing new having happened. But on this particular day, something was different.
 She woke up to the sound of birds outside her window, and instead of getting out of bed and going about her day like normal, she decided to go outside and see what was happening.

Once she was outside, she saw that the sky was a beautiful blue and the sun was shining. All around her, flowers were blooming and trees were blossoming. It was as if the whole world had come alive just for her. She stood there for a moment, taking it all in, before she realized that she was late for school.

She ran off to class, but she couldn't help but feel different than usual. Something about this day felt special, and she knew that from now on things would never be quite the same again.
