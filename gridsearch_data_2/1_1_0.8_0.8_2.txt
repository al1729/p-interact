The life of a small-town girl only ever seemed to be one of boredom and simplicity. She would wake up each day, do the same things she always did, and go to bed with nothing new having happened. But on this particular day, something was different.
 She woke up earlier than usual and decided to take a walk outside. She had never done this before, and she found herself feeling pleasantly surprised by the peace and beauty of the morning. As she walked, she felt something inside of her shifting; it was as if her perspective on life was changing.

For the first time, she noticed the intricacies of the nature around her and the way the sun kissed her skin. She felt alive in a way she never had before. This newfound appreciation for life continued to grow within her as she went about her day-to-day activities. Even when things got tough, she was able to find happiness in the small moments.

The girl had always thought that happiness was something that happened to other people - something that happened to those who led exciting lives full of adventure. But she realized that happiness could be found in even the most simplest of things. And it was then that she knew she had finally discovered what it meant to truly be alive.
