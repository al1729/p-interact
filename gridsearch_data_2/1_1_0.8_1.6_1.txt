The life of a small-town girl only ever seemed to be one of boredom and simplicity. She would wake up each day, do the same things she always did, and go to bed with nothing new having happened. But on this particular day, something was different.
 She woke up feeling nervous, as if something exciting was about to happen. She couldn't shake the feeling all day, and by the time night fell, she was sure of it.

She went to bed early that night, telling herself that whatever was going to happen would happen while she was asleep. And sure enough, when she woke up the next morning, her whole life had changed. She was now a world-famous author, with her book having topped all the charts. She was rich, famous, and happy beyond belief.

And it all started with that one strange feeling on what seemed like just another ordinary day.
