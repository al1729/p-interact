The life of a small-town girl only ever seemed to be one of boredom and simplicity. She would wake up each day, do the same things she always did, and go to bed with nothing new having happened. But on this particular day, something was different.
 She woke up feeling strange, as if something was about to happen. She couldn't explain it, but she had a feeling that today was going to be different.

As the day went on, she started to feel more and more uneasy. It was like there was something big that was going to happen, but she didn't know what it was. The feeling stayed with her all day long until finally, at nightfall, she knew what it was. She was going to die tonight.

She didn't know how she knew, but she was sure of it. And surprisingly, she wasn't scared. She felt at peace with herself and accepting of her fate. She went to bed that night knowing that this would be her last night alive and somehow, she slept soundly knowing that everything would be okay in the end.
