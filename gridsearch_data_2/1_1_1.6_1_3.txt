The life of a small-town girl only ever seemed to be one of boredom and simplicity. She would wake up each day, do the same things she always did, and go to bed with nothing new having happened. But on this particular day, something was different.
 She woke up feeling oddly restless, itching for something more. So without any clear plan in mind, she set off on a journey.

She walked for hours, taking in the sights and sounds of the world around her. She passed through forests and fields, over rivers and hills. The further she got from her home, the more excited she felt. Eventually, she reached a city â€“ one she had only ever seen in pictures before. It was bustling and busy and full of life.
