The life of a small-town girl only ever seemed to be one of boredom and simplicity. She would wake up each day, do the same things she always did, and go to bed with nothing new having happened. But on this particular day, something was different.
 The girl woke up to find that her town had been transformed overnight.

She walked out of her house and was immediately greeted by a colorfully dressed man on a unicycle. He told her that she was the lucky winner of a contest she hadn't even known she entered, and that as part of her prize, she would be whisked away to an amazing place where she would have the time of her life.

The girl couldn't believe it as she was helped into a sparkling carriage pulled by two beautiful horses. She waved goodbye to her hometown as it disappeared into the distance, feeling like this was finally going to be the adventure she'd always dreamed of.
