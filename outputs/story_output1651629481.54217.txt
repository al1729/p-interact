Joe was a farmer who lived in a small village. He was 36 years old and had a wife named Sarah. They had no children, but they were content with their lives. One day, Joe heard that a wizard was passing


through the village. He was curious to meet the wizard, so he went to see him. The wizard looked at Joe and said, "I can see that you are a man of great strength and courage. I can also see that you are not a magic user. This is a great shame, because you have the potential to become a great wizard." Joe was disappointed, but he thanked the wizard for his advice.
